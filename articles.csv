"In recent years, I’ve caught a rather nasty case of replay anxiety, an increasingly common malady in American sports. The afflicted cannot watch a long touchdown run, a buzzer beater or a no-hitter reach the bottom of the ninth inning without worrying that the unfolding drama will be interrupted by the sight of umpires and referees trotting — always a bit too slowly and dutifully — to the replay monitors to review a call. Sitting on my couch, my eyes darting around the screen, I feel the strain of switching between two parallel realities: what the ref sees and what the machine knows.I feel bad for the refs, who, for the most part, are company men in an industry that desperately wants to replace their jobs with automatons. Management, in this case, seems determined to put the ref’s flaws on full display: Every time the ref makes a mistake — especially one that alters the outcome of a game — it’s played over and over again on the giant glowing Jumbotron that hangs over his head, on the television broadcasts and then again, throughout the night, on “SportsCenter.” By the time he wakes up the next morning, his gaffe will have been thoroughly dissected by the forensic experts of YouTube, who stretch every suspicious five-second clip into a meticulously edited short documentary, complete with a menacing violin soundtrack and enraged, caps-locked captions like: “NOTICE NO FOUL WAS CALLED EVEN THOUGH REFEREE X WAS STANDING TWO FEET AWAY!!!”Even the quants have it out for refs. In 2005, John Ball, a data analyst and rabid Houston Rockets fan, had a fit of referee paranoia. The Rockets had just lost a series to the Dallas Mavericks. Jeff Van Gundy, the Rockets’ coach, had been fined a record $100,000 for insinuating that the Mavericks’ owner, Mark Cuban, had persuaded the referees to call more offensive fouls on the Rockets center Yao Ming. Ball ran a popular Yao fan site at the time, and he later began to compile a database that tracked information on referees’ habits. Along with a small team of fellow analysts, Ball watched hundreds of hours of tape to note all the times when a referee missed a call or ignored a violation. They found that there were roughly 20 to 30 bad calls per game and that each ref has predictable patterns of behavior — some call more charging fouls, others hate to blow the whistle on traveling violations and others give more leniency to superstars. Some N.B.A. teams now use the behavioral patterns Ball tracks to develop game plans around referees. Ball’s data, for example, showed that Derek Fisher, the squat, blockheaded former point guard and recently fired Knicks coach, had an unusual talent for drawing illegal screen calls on his opponents from susceptible referees.",sports

"Detailed accusations of state-sponsored doping among Russian athletes have spurred serious debate about whether the country should be allowed to compete in the coming Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.“We have never claimed that we do not have doping problems,” the Russian Ministry of Sport said last week after the former director of the country’s antidoping laboratory described widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs by Russia’s Olympians.But what, exactly, are those doping problems? And how will they affect Russia’s eligibility for the Rio Games?Do Russian athletes dope more than other athletes?That’s impossible to know. But we do know that they get caught more. Russian athletes had more positive doping tests than athletes from any other country in 2014, the most recent year for which data is available from the World Anti-Doping Agency.",sports
"If you’ve ever heard Walton call a game, the hyperbole will have a familiar ring: The man has made an art of unapologetic exaggeration. Of Maurice Lucas, Walton writes that he didn’t commit mere fouls; when the Portland power forward put a body on you, it was a “crime against human decency.” Rarely is Walton content to choose a single adjective when two might do twice as well. Of the Blazers’ guard Johnny Davis, he writes: “His joining our active squad was very much like the night Mickey Hart joined the Grateful Dead. History was made, and the future had a new script. We became incomparable, unstoppable and beyond description.”Whether you find this style entertaining or irritating will correlate with your tolerance for fish stories and the drumming of Mickey Hart. The substance of the man, however, is undeniably compelling: a generational talent and a true product of his generation. Among Walton’s boasts are that he has attended “more than 859” Grateful Dead shows and read every book by David Halberstam. All, that is, save “The Breaks of the Game.” The redheaded center writes with admirable candor about his failings as a player and the betrayals of his body. But when it comes to the Portland years, he prefers to remember the 1976-77 season, when the Bill Walton-led Trail Blazers won it all.The cost of injury, not just to athletes but to an entire sport, is the subject of THE ARM: Inside the Billion-Dollar Mystery of the Most Valuable Commodity in Sports (Harper, $26.99), by Jeff Passan. Despite its title, the book is really about the elbow, and more specifically still, the ulnar collateral ligament, which Passan, a columnist at Yahoo Sports, describes as “a finicky little bastard, ill-equipped to stand up long-term to the single fastest movement the body can generate: the throwing motion.” When your favorite pitcher goes down for the season, it’s likely because he’s shredded his U.C.L.Thanks to Tommy John surgery — named for the Dodgers southpaw who was the first to undergo it, in 1974 — a U.C.L. tear is no longer a career-ending injury. But Passan is troubled by the sport’s growing reliance on the procedure. The recovery process is grueling, and not everyone returns to form. To Passan, the Tommy John option has allowed organized baseball to paper over a scandalous failure: It has no idea how to take care of pitchers’ arms. Even as advanced analytics have come to inform nearly every facet of the game, teams remain content to rely on guesswork — arbitrary pitch counts and innings limits — when it comes to pitchers’ arms.Passan varies his approach to his subject like an ace mixing his speeds, leaving the reader happily guessing at what’s coming next. He embeds with the veteran reliever Todd Coffey as he undergoes Tommy John in the hopes of making a late-career comeback, providing a vivid play-by-play of the tendon-harvesting and bone-drilling that go on in the O.R. He paints an affecting portrait of Daniel Hudson, an Arizona Diamondbacks right-hander who is one of the unlucky ones: His surgery fails, threatening to end his career before it’s begun. He indicts the cutthroat world of youth baseball for its role in the epidemic of U.C.L. tears among young pitchers, describing a system that takes “underdeveloped arms and pressures them to show off for the radar guns they’re taught will determine their future.” From no less an authority than Sandy Kou­fax, Passan receives an oral history of the rigors of the pre-Tommy John era, when pitchers took anti-­inflammatory drugs intended for horses and doctors pulled teeth to relieve shoulder pain.",sports
"Wilfred Benitez had his first professional fight at 15. At 17, he won the World Boxing Council light welterweight championship, beating 30-year-old Antonio Cervantes.16Freddy Adu has been a disappointment since signing as a pro with D.C. United at age 14. After many stops, he is now a member of the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League at 26. But he still holds the record for the youngest United States national team appearance; in 2006, at 16, he came on as a substitute in a friendly against Canada.Martina Hingis became the youngest major winner when she won the 1997 Australian Open at 16. She won four more Grand Slam singles titles over the next three years, but no more after age 18.15Joe Nuxhall was the youngest ever to play in the major leagues, pitching briefly in a game for the Reds when he was 15 during the wartime player shortages of 1944. It took him eight years to get back to the big leagues, but he eventually pitched respectably until he was 37.14Dominique Moceanu is the youngest of the many young American gymnasts to win an Olympic gold medal. Her medal came in the women’s team competition at the 1996 Atlanta Games at age 14. That record will not be broken under the current rules, which require a gymnast to turn 16 in the calendar year of the Olympics.13The youngest American gold medalist, and officially the youngest from any nation in the Summer Games, is Marjorie Gestring, who won in springboard diving at 13 in 1936 in Berlin. The New York Times described her as “a blond, small and very much tanned child from sunny California.” She would have been favored for another gold in 1940, but those Games were canceled because of World War II.An even younger athlete took home gold in the Winter Games: Kim Yun-Mi was 185 days younger than Gestring when she was a member of South Korea’s winning short-track speedskating relay team in 1994.???After the Dutch rowing pair of Roelof Klein and François Brandt lost a preliminary heat at the 1900 Olympics in Paris, they suspected the reason was that their coxswain was a man, rather than a child, as the French were using. They recruited a French boy for the final and won. The boy’s name and age are unknown (estimates range from 7 to 12), but he is in all probability the youngest gold medalist ever.",sports
"It has, which suggests that ESPN might be very indulgent if The Undefeated is not an advertising or audience magnet. To do what Whitlock could not, ESPN hired Merida, a calm, experienced leader who was the first African-American managing editor at The Washington Post. But ESPN retained The Undefeated name, which comes from a quotation by Maya Angelou, and its original mission to be a prominent voice on race.“Race is the subject of our time,” Merida said, when asked why he wanted to tackle the subject. “We can’t escape it. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t have that confidence.”Describing his desire for the site to be “unapologetic and brave,” he added: “I will be fearless but not reckless. We want to be smart and cool. We want to be a thought leader.”At one point during the gathering, Marie Donoghue, the ESPN executive vice president who oversees The Undefeated, looked at Merida and said, “This is my most successful deal ever — to bring Kevin over here.”Donoghue’s trust in Merida underscores how much ESPN believes in his ability to produce a compelling and, more important, enduring site that will be original, independent and complementary to ESPN’s television programming and digital properties like espn.com.Merida’s success will rest on people embracing a site that is far more ruminative than espn.com, which is packed with scores, game stories, analysis and highlights — as well as narrative journalism. He wants people talking about it in his barbershop — and many other places, virtual or otherwise. “And if they’re on Snapchat or Twitter,” he said, “I’d want The Undefeated’s work to find them.”Donoghue added: “We want to engage an audience that finds something we’re not currently offering at ESPN.”",sports
"When Briles recruited a troubled player, Sam Ukwuachu, from Boise State, a student publication advised that the football player was known as a fine gentleman.That fine gentleman was later convicted of a brutal sexual assault of a female soccer player.We in the news media are not blameless. We love finding down-home pleasures such as Coach Briles, whom we described as a turnaround specialist. “Given the timbre of his magnificent voice and his knack for telling a story, a more apt comparison for the coach might be Johnny Cash,” Sports Illustrated noted a few years ago.That same coach took no action to protect young women even when top officials were “aware of a potential pattern of sexual violence by multiple football players.” The coach and his staff “affirmatively chose not to report” – that is, to cover up – “sexual violence and dating violence” to college administrators.The report is delicate as to what Starr knew, or not. He is, however, central to this narrative. When he walked into Waco, he proclaimed himself a new man. He didn’t like to talk much about his time as a federal judge and special prosecutor in Washington.He did talk endlessly about football and the joy of amateur athletics.Early last season, my colleague Marc Tracy noted, Starr fixed his hand into the shape of a bear claw and led thousands of freshmen on a raucous charge across the football field. And he raised hundreds of millions of dollars needed to build a new stadium that calls to mind the Great Pyramid of Cheops.Long ago, I was a political writer for The Washington Post’s Style section, and I covered the Roman circus that was Starr, Monica, the libidinous Bubba and an impeachment trial.I recall sitting there as Starr, his blue eyes owlish, his skin pink and dimpled, sat before Congress and in a sonorous I-say-this-more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger tone, pounced light as a cat on a scalawag president.",sports
"Houston hosted the world weight lifting championships last year. The sport’s greatest athletes, many Olympians among them, hoisted staggering amounts of weight above their heads, and the fans there oohed and aahed.Could those fans believe what they were seeing? No, not really. The feats looked superhuman. There was good reason for those fans not to believe their eyes.Seventeen of the weight lifters who competed in Houston — including many medal winners — tested positive for banned drugs. So what the fans were seeing wasn’t a credible sport at its best. What they saw was a lot of cheating.Did that matter? Maybe not.“The die-hard weight lifting fans, they’re well aware of what’s going on, so none of it was a shock to them,” said Chris Massey, the director of events at Harris County-Houston Sports Authority. “The other people were just out for the entertainment value of it. I don’t even know if any of them have connected the dots.”",sports
"At the time, Mickelson owed Walters gambling debts. Although he was a serious gambler, Mickelson was not a big stock trader, with only about $250,000 in the market, according to the S.E.C. Yet on July 30 and 31, 2012, after a series of phone calls and texts with Walters, Mickelson bought $2.4 million worth of Dean Foods stock — some of it with money he borrowed. “These were his first ever Dean Foods purchases,” the S.E.C. noted.You know, of course, what happened next: A week later, Dean Foods announced the WhiteWave spinoff. The stock jumped 40 percent. The very next day, Mickelson sold his Dean Foods stock, reaping a profit of $931,000.The case against Walters, as outlined by the S.E.C. and the United States attorney’s office, appears to be strong. In all, the government says, the inside information Walters got from Davis was worth $40 million. The government goes out of its way to play up the personal benefit Davis received in return. An inveterate gambler trying to keep up an unsustainable lifestyle, he owed money to the I.R.S. and others, including Walters. More than once, Walters bailed him out by either lending him money or arranging for a loan. The loans totaled nearly $2 million.It is also clear that Walters, who is alleged to have tipped off Mickelson in turn, got a benefit from his tippee. According to the S.E.C., Mickelson used some of his Dean Foods profits to pay back his gambling debt to Walters. But did Mickelson know about the personal benefit the original tipper, Davis, was receiving? I know it sounds a little strange, but that really is the key legal question in the wake of the Newman decision. If he didn’t know that Davis was receiving a personal benefit in return for giving inside information to Walters, he’s off the hook.(A quick aside: According to Forbes, Mickelson has reaped around $500 million in career earnings, and gets some $50 million a year in endorsement income. The fact that he was trading in Dean Foods to repay a debt to Walters surely raises questions about Mickelson’s financial decision-making, well apart from whether he traded on inside information.)In its complaint against Walters, the S.E.C. seems to have highlighted Mickelson’s involvement in the case. But ultimately, it merely named him a “relief defendant,” meaning that all he had to do was return the money he had made from the Dean Foods trade, plus interest. He readily agreed. (The total is about $1.03 million.)A spokesman for Mickelson issued a statement Thursday in which he said that Mickelson didn’t want to “benefit from any transaction that the S.E.C. sees as questionable.” He added that Mickelson regretted any “appearance” that he had fallen short of “the high professional and ethical standards that the companies he represents expect of their employees, associates and Phil himself.”",sports
"The problem with Newell’s critique is that nearly everyone who watches the N.B.A., except a small population of analytics wonks and insiders, really does care where Kevin Durant plays basketball. The zealotry of those in pursuit of some objective “truth” in sports, I’ve started to think, might be turning the entire spectacle into something that can no longer be recognized by a vast majority of fans. If you excise both fandom and the metaphorical weight of how the actions of an athlete might reflect on your own life, then what, exactly, are we watching? And why?The impulse to expunge all this and turn watching sports into an accounting exercise filled with insider jargon reflects some of the eye-rolling elitism that has entered our national political conversation. While neither the stakes nor the messages are analogous, the mechanism through which they are conveyed feels very much the same. It is, in essence, a walling-off between those who believe themselves to be in the know and the simps who lap up everything they watch on cable news. But not all narratives, whether political or athletic, are fictions, and there are still emotional and existential lessons that can be summoned by the sight of men and women chasing a ball around a field.There is ample ground between the current approach to N.F.L. news, for example, which amounts to treating it as either a stock ticker of microtransactions or a perpetual scandal-generating machine, and the attitude given expression earlier this month by John Miller, chief marketing officer for NBC’s Olympic Games coverage, to explain why his network relegated several key Olympic events to tape delay. “More women watch the Games than men,” Miller said, “and for the women, they’re less interested in the result and more interested in the journey.”A defense of sports narratives does not have to accept Miller’s retrograde thinking. That it so often has is not proof that every telling is corrupted, but rather that the authors have mostly failed. Durant versus Westbrook will be next year’s dominant N.B.A. motif because it brings in the full breadth of the rich, if at times overblown, metaphors that have always driven the best sportswriting: loyalty versus self-interest, the individual versus the empire and solidarity with the underdog versus the cynical efficiency of the superteam. The personalities of both players, on court and off, should be enough to compel our attention, supplemented by all the data analysis you could ever want. Even if we should balk at any easy moralizing, there’s no need to sacrifice a good story in the process.",sports
"RIO DE JANEIRO — Across the city from the Olympic Park, in a community sports center called Vila Olímpica Greip, though it doesn’t have a thing to do with the Olympics, a group of teenage girls has arrived to play handball. They want to play handball. They need to play handball.Some have traveled an hour and a half by bus to get to this aging center, where the front gates are adorned with Olympic rings fashioned out of rubber tubing tied together with fishing wire. At the outdoor concrete handball court, the water fountains have cobwebs but no water, and a wooden situp bench is so rotted that you can fit your hand through the holes in it.But these 10 girls are here to play and to learn, and the girls take this commitment seriously.“Handball has brought me everything,” said Bruna Santos, 15. “I was nobody.

"“D.F.S. is the gift that keeps on giving — it’s mainstreamed our business,” Sara Rayme, a vice president with the American Gaming Association, said at a recent gambling symposium.In fact, DraftKings and FanDuel are in danger of becoming roadkill as the momentum for legalized sports betting continues to build. Legislators in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and California have already pushed bills to legalize sports betting in order to increase revenue, and American professional sports leagues, once among the fiercest opponents, are bracing for an era in which betting is legal. N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver has said that it is time for legalized gambling and that the league is prepared for it. The N.H.L. just awarded its 31st franchise to Las Vegas, and the N.F.L. is considering allowing the Oakland Raiders to move there.Last year, at the beginning of the N.F.L. season, DraftKings and FanDuel blitzed sports broadcasts with hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising. Daily fantasy sports appeared to be a virtual cash machine. The companies were valued at more than $1 billion each. Their investors included Major League Baseball, the N.B.A., and the N.F.L.; the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and the New England Patriots owner Robert K. Kraft; and major media companies like NBC.Lobbying and legal costs, however, have shredded their bottom lines and will continue to do so. New York is only the eighth state to declare daily fantasy sports legal, and the companies are facing expensive efforts to have their games legalized in the big markets of Illinois and Texas.In addition, Schneiderman said Wednesday that his office would continue to pursue “false advertising and consumer fraud claims for past misconduct” against DraftKings and FanDuel, both of which are also facing scores of class-action lawsuits across the country.The auditors for the New York-based FanDuel have expressed “significant doubt” about the company’s future if more states do not decide fantasy sports betting is legal and find ways to tax and regulate it. DraftKings, which is based in Boston, may be in worse shape. This year, Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox revealed in a regulatory filing that it had marked down its $160 million investment in DraftKings by more than 60 percent.Do not expect to be bombarded with ads or seduced by the lure of easy money when the N.F.L season kicks off. Both DraftKings and FanDuel say they will significantly scale back their marketing.",sports
"STAMFORD, Conn. — NBC Sports’ promise to stream every sport live at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro is fulfilled here at its headquarters — a former Clairol factory — where the digital feeds from every event are sent to tablets, computers, smartphones and other connected devices. They are visible on flat screens throughout the vast broadcast operations center — mosaics of sports that are being played simultaneously.Streaming is a part of NBC’s Olympic future — an extension and repudiation of a history in which the prime-time broadcast was not to be trifled with. But the new model is unfolding in Rio: unfettered live streaming of all events and live Olympic programming on NBCUniversal’s cable networks, combined with NBC’s traditional prime-time broadcast, which has live and taped elements.Through Thursday, NBC’s live streaming had reached 1.28 billion minutes — more than in all of the 2012 London Olympics. The minutes have helped NBC add the equivalent of a few hundred thousand viewers to a prime-time broadcast audience that has fallen since 2012. Still, NBC’s streaming is less than halfway to the 2.6 billion live minutes that ESPN streamed during the 2014 World Cup.“Going past one billion minutes — I’m impressed, excited and overjoyed,” said Eric Black, the chief technology officer of NBC Sports Group Digital, who has watched Olympic streaming advance, sometimes fitfully, over several Olympics. He recalled an unexpectedly large surge of streaming during the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, for the men’s United States-Russia preliminary-round game in hockey, at 7:30 a.m. Eastern.",sports
"RIO DE JANEIRO — Proud and beautiful as this seaside city is, glorious as the feats of athleticism and sportsmanship were these past two weeks, these Games underline that the Olympic model is fractured.As we depart, Rio de Janeiro is left with stadiums for which it has little use and swimming pools far removed from the working class who could dearly use them. Tens of thousands of residents were displaced, a golf course sits atop a former nature preserve, and the towers of the athletes’ village will have a second life as luxury housing. Rio’s state government turns its pockets inside out looking for money to pay salaries and to keep hospitals open. The army withdraws, and fears rise that crime will spiral.The International Olympic Committee has taken steps toward reform. But what it demands of nations is basically unchanged: Build us expensive monuments with a shelf life of two weeks. The I.O.C. has no hammer to bring down when cities fail to deliver on environmental promises.There is a more sustainable and less ruinous path, and I will get to that. First, I should wrestle with the challenge tossed down by my colleague Roger Cohen. He is an incisive, humane observer, and he argued that critics have the Rio Olympics all wrong.",sports
"PhotoPersonal Health Jane Brody on health and aging.Mountain biking, helicopter skiing, river surfing, BASE jumping, waterfall kayaking, ice climbing and other extreme sports that put participants at risk of serious injury, even death, grow annually in popularity.I know what you’re thinking, I thought it too: Why would anyone pursue activities so dangerous that you must sign a waiver absolving the organizers of all responsibility for a catastrophic accident? One small slip, a brief lapse of attention, and you’re history.The traditional public perception is that “extreme sports participation is an unhealthy, pathological need for uncertainty, thrills and excitement,” Eric Brymer, an exercise specialist, wrote in 2010, when he was at Queensland University of Technology.But is it really just about chasing an adrenaline rush? And are these action sports as dangerous to devoted participants as they seem on television and in YouTube videos?Even watching the recent gruesome footage of the French Olympic gymnast Samir Ait Said, who broke his leg in Rio during a vault landing, can make one wonder whether it is wise to pursue even so “tame” an activity as gymnastics.The derring-do of Olympic competitors and the death in an avalanche in July of Matilda Rapaport, a Swedish extreme skier, while being filmed in the Andes, prompted me to look more closely at why so many people choose to try these sports, how dangerous they are and how hazards can be minimized.There are no reliable statistics to inform a potential participant of the risks of any sport, even everyday activities school children and amateur and professional athletes engage in, like soccer, skateboarding, basketball and football. While individual injuries and deaths are well publicized, there are no data to show how likely these are.Furthermore, Jamie F. Burr of the University of Prince Edward Island and colleagues wrote in Canadian Family Physician, the public perception of risk is distorted: “Risk-taking is inherently human and can be an important factor in personal development. Injuries incurred while engaging in more traditional physical activities are regarded as ‘unfortunate accidents,’ while injuries resulting from participation in adventure sports are viewed as ‘foreseeable and foolhardy.’”Second, the motivations offered by extreme sports participants for why they are so willing to assume the risks involved are not what you might expect. Adventure sports are not “an outlet for ‘crazy’ individuals with an unhealthy relationship to fear, who are pathological in their search for risk or living out a death wish,” Dr. Brymer and his colleague at Queensland University, Robert Schweitzer, wrote.Yes, at first, having survived an attempt or two is exhilarating, and the emotional high (which, by the way, results from dopamine release in the brain, not adrenaline) prompts them to come back for more.A study by John H. Kerr, a kinesiologist at the University of British Columbia, and Susan Houge Mackenzie, a movement specialist then at the University of Idaho, quoted a 26-year-old river surfer identified only as Jody, who said, “You’re just stoked.” Then she added, “It’s not just your adrenaline. It’s a sense of achievement. You set out to do something and you’ve done it — it’s everything leading up to it, the skills that you have or the hard work that you’ve done.”Nor is it that extreme sports participants lack fear. “Fear is an essential element to their survival,” Dr. Brymer and Dr. Schweitzer explained. In interviews with extreme athletes, they and other researchers have learned that participants consider fear “a healthy, productive experience,” prompting them to take appropriate precautions that enhance the chances of surviving uninjured.As one solo rope-free mountain climber told the researchers, , “If I panic, I’m lost, dead.” He learned to thwart panic and instead stay relaxed and focused, maintaining clarity and good judgment that help to protect him.Also important, a 30-year-old BASE jumper identified as “TB” told Dr. Brymer, is to “learn everything possible about the sport; learn about weather conditions, learn about wind, learn about what wind does in and around buildings and structures and cliffs, etc., so you know what you can do and what you can’t do.”Through interviews with many regular extreme sports participants, researchers have found that the emotional high becomes less and less important with time. As participants continue to pursue the activities, other motives and perceived benefits to health and well-being take precedence.Mr. Kerr and Dr. Mackenzie reported that participants experienced such benefits as feeling strong, healthy and fit; connecting with nature and being more in touch with one’s surroundings; gaining self-confidence; and becoming self-sufficient.Overcoming fear is a near-universal goal for participants, the Australian researchers wrote. A young woman BASE jumper they interviewed described fear as a gateway to transcendence, calling her sport the “ultimate metaphor for jumping into life rather than standing on the edge quivering.”Devoted extreme sport participants regard safety as their highest priority. They learn the skills needed for their chosen sport, they train to become sufficiently expert at it and to know how to judge the extent of their ability, said Dr. Vani Sabesan, an orthopedic surgeon at Western Michigan University School of Medicine.“Someone with medical expertise should be present to make sure you have the right protective gear and to rescue you if something goes wrong,” she said.Susan McGowen, an athletic trainer at the University of New Mexico College of Education, who provided such oversight for a dozen years at the X-Games, said, “Just because you’ve seen it on TV or YouTube, don’t assume anybody can go out and try to duplicate the feats of extreme athletes. It takes years and years of practice and progress to get to those levels.”Dr. McGowen emphasized the importance of having an athletic trainer present at all organized activities — school and youth leagues as well as amateur and professional games, who can enhance safety through proper nutrition, well-maintained equipment and good coaching, as well as properly care for an injured athlete.Such guidance is especially important for people planning to participate in an extreme sport. “People are terrible judges of risk,” David O. Horton, a professor of law at the University of California, Davis, told me. “They don’t understand the language of the contracts they sign saying that they have no legal rights if something should go wrong. Organizers don’t have to spell out all the risks for the contract to be enforceable.”His advice: “Be as cleareyed as you can be about what can possibly go wrong — ask questions, do research about potential downsides, and don’t try anything you’re not capable of or properly equipped to do.”Related:For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter.",sports
"A study of N.C.A.A. Division I major infractions cases from 1953 to 2014 indicated that football and men’s basketball, which attract the most revenue, accounted for 83 percent of the total.It also determined that probation and public reprimand and censure were the most common penalties.The Temple University Sport Industry Research Center prepared the report, which was released for the N.C.A.A. Division I Committee on Infractions.The center’s director and the report’s co-author, Jeremy Jordan, said the study was the first to review all major infractions cases for Division I. Of the 554 cases, 459 involved football, men’s basketball or both.Universities from Power Five conferences accounted for 40 percent of all major infractions cases. The report found that the members of those conferences were generally treated no differently from universities in other leagues, in terms of penalties.",sports
"A formal lobbying effort on Capitol Hill for the expansion of legalized wagering may begin as early as 2017.“Washington has a responsibility to fix a failed law that it created nearly 25 years ago,” said Geoff Freeman, the American Gaming Association’s president and chief executive. “A federal government prohibition has driven an illegal, and occasionally dangerous, sports betting market of at least $150 billion annually. Law enforcement, mayors, leaders in sports, fans and many others agree that it’s time for a regulated sports betting marketplace that protects consumers, communities and the integrity of sports we enjoy.”The four major professional sports leagues and the N.C.A.A. sued New Jersey in 2012, saying that the expansion of legal sports betting would damage the integrity of their games and lead to more game fixing.“We are pleased the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has denied New Jersey’s latest attempt to allow sports wagering in the state,” the N.C.A.A. said in a statement about Tuesday’s ruling. “As other courts have acknowledged, federal law does not permit New Jersey’s actions. The N.C.A.A. continues to believe that Paspa is an important law that appropriately protects the integrity of sport in America.”In recent years, however, the professional leagues have acknowledged that they are getting ready for an era in which betting is legal. Commissioner Adam Silver of the N.B.A. has said that betting on his league’s games should be legal and regulated. The N.H.L. recently awarded its 31st franchise to Las Vegas, and the N.F.L. is considering allowing the Oakland Raiders to move there.New Jersey lawmakers and sports gambling proponents have called the leagues’ shifting stances hypocritical, especially because Major League Baseball, the N.B.A., and the N.F.L. owners Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys and Robert K. Kraft of the New England Patriots have financial stakes in daily fantasy sports companies, which are fighting their own battles with states to be declared legal. So far, only eight states have made such declarations.“To date, the leagues and others have not sufficiently explained the difference between fantasy sports, sports betting and other forms of gambling,” Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said in May.",sports
"“I think we have very good games,” said Sam Flood, the executive producer of NBC Sports and NBCSN. “But we all know the back half of the season can be a bit of a crapshoot. You’re not sure who’s going to be great and who’s not going to be great. Who would have thought the Dallas Cowboys would be the best team in football right now, by their record? Minnesota started as the best team in the N.F.L. and has lost a few in a row.”The Cowboys and the Vikings will play Dec. 1.NBC’s Thursday night schedule is a bit different from CBS’s, which took a break during Week 4. But NBC’s goes for six straight weeks because the Thanksgiving night game is part of its Sunday night package.“Our excitement is to have this run until the end of the season and into holiday shopping, which has a lot of advantages for our ad sales people,” Flood said Monday during a media gathering at a Manhattan restaurant.The N.F.L. has tried hard over the years to turn Thursday night games into an attraction that would bolster NFL Network and rival the older Sunday and Monday night franchises. The league has increased the number of Thursday night over the years, but it has found its biggest success in selling some of the games, first to CBS, and now to CBS and NBC, because broadcast networks reach larger audiences than a league-owned channel like NFL Network.But Thursday night games have been less attractive to players, who dislike the short week of preparation time after Sunday, and to fans who see that the mostly divisional matchups don’t generally rival those of other prime-time packages. The Thursday broadcasts have also become part of a discussion about whether the N.F.L. is overwhelming fans with too many games.Rodney Harrison, an analyst on NBC’s pregame show, said that he was looking less at the election as a factor in shrinking audiences than quality games. “The problem is you have to go back to earning the right to be on television rather than saying, ‘We have all these slots, on Sunday, Thursday, Sunday and Monday.’ ”The remark was targeted largely at the Thursday night package. Twenty-nine teams play at least one game on the Thursday night package that is being carried by CBS, NBC and NFL Network. The other three play on Thanksgiving.",sports

"On July 24, 1959, months after coming to power, Fidel Castro took the mound at a baseball stadium in Havana to pitch an exhibition for a team of fellow revolutionaries known as Los Barbudos, the Bearded Ones.He pitched an inning or two against a team from the Cuban military police and, by some accounts, struck out two batters.“He threw a few pitches, people were swinging wildly and letting themselves be struck out by the Leader,” said Roberto González Echevarría, a native of Cuba who is a literature professor at Yale and the author of “The Pride of Havana: A History of Cuban Baseball.”Mr. Castro, who died Friday at 90, also avidly followed Havana’s Sugar Kings of the International League, a Class AAA team in the Cincinnati Reds’ farm system from 1954 to 1960. He went to some games because he was a fan and “he liked being on TV,” Mr. González Echevarría said.",sports
"“What if I broke all her teeth?” he adds. “What if I broke her nose? If I hit her in one eye and she loses that?”No doubt, the extended nets have prevented some injuries. But the incidents I’ve just described strongly suggest something that seems pretty obvious: The new netting is in the wrong place.The hardest-hit balls tend not to land in the space between home plate and the near end of the dugout, where the new netting has been placed. The real rockets go over the dugouts or into the field-level seats down the first- and third-base lines. Almost all of the badly injured fans this season were sitting in those seats.I’ve written before about the reasons baseball hasn’t wanted to extend netting further: Many fans don’t want it; nets can hinder the intimacy between the fans and the players that baseball treasures; and, most heinously, the existence of the so-called “baseball rule,” which forces fans to assume any risk of injury during baseball games, and which the courts have consistently upheld.If the baseball rule were to go away — and there are a handful of recent lawsuits that seem to be having some success in chipping away at it — you can bet that there would be netting protecting fans all the way to the foul poles. The fact that injured fans can’t sue has allowed baseball to look the other way, for far too long, ignoring the serious damage foul balls can cause.Critics of the new netting complain that it is an example of the nanny state run amok — that, in percentage terms, the number of people who get hurt at games is minuscule. But with tens of thousands of balls flying into the seats every season, it’s also true that there is a 100 percent chance that a handful of fans will suffer truly terrible injuries. It is hard to see how preventing a woman from losing her eye, or a child from getting his skull fractured, is an example of the nanny state.Eddie and Kristy David, the parents of James David, the young boy whose skull was fractured, told me that they felt “blessed and thankful” that his injuries hadn’t been worse. He had a concussion and bleeding in his brain, but he did not require surgery. He has a dent in his head, however, that will never go away.James’s doctor won’t let him play sports for now. Worried about another concussion, the Davids insist that he wear a helmet when he is on a swing set or in the schoolyard. “It is a fear that we live with daily,” Kristy told me.",sports
"The daily fantasy sports companies DraftKings and FanDuel have agreed to merge after a turbulent year in which both of their values plummeted as several attorneys general questioned the legality of their games in their states.The merger must be approved by regulators and will take time — the companies said they expected the deal to close in the second half of 2017. Until then, both sides will operate under their own brands.The merger was one of necessity: Lobbying and legal costs had damaged both companies’ bottom lines to the extent that representatives of the companies last month asked the New York attorney general’s office to allow them to pay a combined $12 million settlement in installments after claims that they employed false and deceptive advertising practices, two people familiar with those negotiations said.In recent weeks, according to these two people, FanDuel, based in New York, laid off more than 60 people, and both companies have acknowledged that they are months behind in their payments to vendors, especially to the array of public relations and lobbying firms that they have employed across the nation to persuade individual state legislatures to legalize daily fantasy games — the most critical component of rebuilding their business.",sports
"To the Editor:Re “Head Trauma Haunts the Gridiron” (editorial, Oct. 16):An estimated 250,000 sports-related concussions or traumatic brain injury were diagnosed in children under 19 in 2009, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.No helmet technology or rule change can prevent concussion. The only way to address this critical and growing concern, is to properly detect, monitor and provide access to trained medical experts. This can be accomplished with helmet sensors that detect and record critical impact data.Existing helmets can be retrofitted with sensors. Many college football teams use this technology.Why aren’t middle and high schools protecting their students as well? This technology gives coaches, parents and school personnel important information about training and playing techniques, how often a player has suffered a head trauma, and when and if a player should return or be removed from a game to prevent lifelong damage.If technology exists to help protect children who participate in contact sports, why isn’t it mandated by local or state authorities?",sports

"It happened so fast: One moment I was running trails, the next I was staring a black-bear sow in the face, so close I could smell it, wild and pungent and alarming, and I knew it could smell me, too, my fear.I was in the middle of a rainy 22-mile run in Far North Bicentennial Park on the outskirts of Anchorage, where I live. It was late July, a time when grizzlies sweep down from the mountains to feast on the red-flecked salmon swimming up Campbell Creek. But I was miles from the water. I had planned my route away from the creek, and I hadn’t seen bear scat in more than an hour. As I crested a hill, a crash sounded from my right, and I instinctively moved to the left, expecting a moose. But it was the sow with three cubs. The cubs fled up a tree. The sow paused in front of me, as if waiting.I backed into the brush, fortifying myself behind a skinny grove of alder trees, moving slowly, carefully, never taking my eyes off the bear. When it veered as if to leave I felt such relief that my throat loosened and small gasps escaped my lips. Then it abruptly turned and charged directly at me.It’s impossible to run the trails around Alaska without thinking about bears. There are piles of scat everywhere, dotted with blueberry and cranberry seeds that glint in the sun, reminders that you have to be careful. You have to be versed in bear awareness, bear etiquette and bear protocol. Headphones are a no-no and going alone is discouraged. Making noise and carrying bear spray is recommended.",sports

"Barchi, the president, hired Julie Hermann as athletic director. He described her as “one of the most respected athletic administrators in the country.” Her pay and benefits were nearly half a million dollars.More or less immediately, it was reported that Hermann, who earlier served as the volleyball coach at Tennessee, had demeaned her players as “whores, alcoholics and learning disabled.”Hermann was shown the door in 2015 in a purge that also claimed Kyle Flood, the football coach.Flood was accused of trying to persuade a dance appreciation teacher to change a failing grade for one of his players. Seven of his players were arrested, on charges including armed burglary and an unprovoked punch that broke a student’s jaw. An additional 16 players tested positive for banned substances, reportedly marijuana, which under university rules merited suspensions. The football staff covered this up.More seriously, Rutgers, like other “big-time” schools, chooses pretty female students as “ambassadors” to show male recruits around campus. The N.C.A.A. has accused Rutgers of allowing two ambassadors to meet with the recruits in dorm rooms, which is prohibited.Rutgers’s fired athletic officials will draw severance payments for years to come. Hermann is owed about $1.2 million over the next two years. Flood will pull down $2.1 million. Eddie Jordan, the basketball coach who, refreshingly, was fired for losing rather than for abusing his players, will receive almost $1.9 million.Hence the athletic department’s need for a loan.Pernetti no longer draws a university check. No wolf has arrived at his door. In one of his last acts as athletic director, he persuaded Rutgers to pay $7 million to end its contract with a sports marketing firm. Shortly after he was fired, Rutgers signed an 11-year, $65 million contract with IMG College to handle sports marketing for the university.Two years ago, IMG hired Pernetti as president for multimedia, covering Rutgers and other colleges.An intriguing aspect of Rutgers’s dive into big-time sports is that each time a coach or an athletic director left soaked in scandal, the successor received more money. The departed football coach made $1.25 million; the new coach makes $2 million. The departed basketball coach made about $1.1 million; the new coach makes $1.6 million.",sports
"“I don’t really know the answer to that question,” he admitted, “except probably it was easy to keep assigning the cast of regulars to the tournament. It just wasn’t on our radar screen.”The thing is, McManus said he had watched and admired Antonelli, who is under contract with ESPN, for so many years that he couldn’t pinpoint the date when he had first noticed her. And when, he said, someone at CBS brought up her name this year — along with the idea to use her broad expertise in an analyst’s role, rather than for infrequent hits as a sideline reporter — the group decided, “Boy, that’s a no-brainer,”But if it was a no-brainer, why did two decades go by without someone thinking of hiring her? It could be, McManus said, that Antonelli works for ESPN, and CBS Sports didn’t think it could hire her away for the tournament, which the network ended up doing quite easily this year.Or, he said, it was “probably just an oversight and a little bit of a lack of creativity, perhaps.” McManus was clear that Antonelli had finally been hired because of her expertise, because of her reputation for preparation and good work — and not because she is a woman.Antonelli knows that her big chance will come with big-time pressure to succeed, in terms of her getting another shot, and for all women who want to be treated equally in roles that remain, to many, male domains.“There’s no margin for error if you hear a woman’s voice during a broadcast,” Antonelli acknowledged. “If you make a mistake, they’ll say, ‘It figures.’ And they will blame it on me being a woman.”",sports
"Having lived in warm climates for several years, we found that even this relatively mild winter in New York was grinding on us, so almost any natural sunlamp would do.Rio Grande, a coastal and jungle resort town about 20 miles east of the capital, San Juan, could not have been more perfect, given that almost every attraction could be reached in 30 minutes or less.Our debates evolved into which day trip was more satisfying.Although Puerto Rico tends to conjure images of palms and beaches, the rain forest just down the road beckoned, as something a little different.You could do worse than start with the rain forest.The El Yunque National Forest, a verdant expanse the size of San Francisco and the only tropical rain forest in the United States forest system, has trails that are clean, well-maintained and well-marked from the roads cutting through it. They funnel you through a rain forest canopy, ringing with the chirps, croaks and shrieks of birds, frogs and other animals, to enticing swimming holes and waterfalls with enough chill in the water to refresh from the near 90-degree heat but not enough to keep you out.La Coca Trail, for instance, rises and falls on its meandering path to the big payoff: a roaring waterfall and pool that beckon you for a dip and, if you can tolerate the pelting, a shower. A hike a little downstream offers more private relaxing.Angelito Trail nearby provides an easier walk and more mellow bathing in a large stream, though locals told us it can get brisk after heavy rains. One natural pool there was deep enough for our two boys to jump from a rope swing.Tropical rain forest. You may be thinking about bugs, particularly mosquitoes, given the Zika outbreak that occurred in Puerto Rico and elsewhere last year.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyBut, visiting in February, we discovered there were not legions of them, and hearty, cool sea breezes helped keep them at bay and the climate quite pleasant.Zika cases are on the wane, Puerto Rican health officials have said, and the virus, which can cause birth defects, is primarily of concern to pregnant women and couples who are trying to become pregnant. Places with Zika outbreaks are safe for the average traveler, though we did follow the precaution of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to generously apply repellent with DEET, as we normally do when visiting the tropics.Really, our biggest anxiety had to do with giving the kids enough of the beach time they demanded.Pick your pleasure.A nameless beach a few minutes down the road from our apartment complex, and accessible via a path of wooden planks, offered fierce waves, which delighted the children as they twisted in the curling break, but kept me on guard. The sand and grass beach was narrow and scattered with seaweed, the kind of relatively isolated place you might crave for an only-the-locals experience, but it might disappoint if you expect comfort and, maybe, an umbrella.Puerto Rico guarantees public access to beaches, even at resorts. Those beaches, of course, tend to be well-maintained and near amenities like a bar. It can be tricky getting to them, though. Our apartment complex was around the bend from the Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Beach Resort and Spa, with its manicured grounds, restaurants, casinos, golf course and well-appointed rooms.Ask at the security gate where the beach is, and you are directed down the road to a place that is not the resort. But if you say you would like to pay for a day pass to the hotel or to visit the casino or restaurants, you are waved in and can park in the garage, which charges by the hour and is a short walk down a path to the beach.It looks like the ones that you see when you Google “Puerto Rico beach.” Clean sand, invitingly clear water ... and populated by a good number of tourists.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

For $5.50, we parked, set up our chairs (you can rent them, and umbrellas, too) and joined local families and fellow bargain hunters. There are concession stands, and the beach abuts a line of food and souvenir kiosks.Vendors come by hawking fresh seafood from coolers. We tried the shrimp and grilled octopus in homemade mojo sauce and ran after the vendor for more.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyBut the best beach by far, and one of the most spectacular we have seen in our years of travel in Mexico and the Caribbean, was Culebra Island.It requires about a 15-mile drive east from Rio Grande to a ferry at the seaside village of Fajardo; it’s a good idea to get there an hour or more before the scheduled time to ensure a seat.After a ferry trip of an hour to 90 minutes, depending on how long it takes to board everyone, you arrive at a funky beach town with taxi buses ready to whisk you to beaches, snorkeling, Jet Skis and other activities minutes away. With our children growing anxious, we opted for the closest beach, Playa Flamenco, and were enthralled.A wide, powdery white-sand beach awaited. Swimming-pool-clear water extended yards out, waist-deep, and even deeper water was the blue of a dusky sky.Gentle but persistent waves playfully banged around the young (and older) daredevils. The presence of a coral reef just offshore seemed an impossibly over-the-top perk, but it had enough fish — lots of blue tang for “Finding Dory” fans — poking around to lure us, some of them zooming off to the shoreline.Culebra now ranks in our household among our top three beaches.Almost everything we did after that teetered on letdown.A popular attraction is nighttime kayaking in a bioluminescent bay in Fajardo. With a guide leading the way, you paddle for a half-hour through a dark mangrove, knocking trees and other boats along the way as novices get used to navigating, into a large bay where luminescent bubbles from micro-organisms trail your hand as you pass it through the water (swimming is no longer permitted).It was a workout for me as my companion, my 11-year-old son, comfy in his backrest-equipped spot, grew tired of paddling and drifted off to sleep at one point. And overall I guess I was expecting science-fiction level luminescence, but the eerie course through the mangrove, with fish darting and splashing to the surface, passed for adventure.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyLong days usually meant quick meals at the apartment, with a couple of supermarkets 10 minutes away good for stocking up on snacks and whatever cooking we were motivated to do.But plenty of restaurants and shops are worth checking out.Three stood out for us.The fresh offerings at La Familia Bakery 2, including mouthwatering sweet bread, are a must, and it’s just off Highway 3 in Rio Grande near a large supermarket.Lluvia, a modern breakfast and lunch cafe you’ll pass on the road to El Yunque, offers rich Puerto Rico-grown coffee and dishes like waffles with bacon cooked in them and a breakfast “cup” overflowing with egg, cheese, pesto sauce and home fries.But El Verde BBQ, a roadside stand along Highway 186 (a major thoroughfare to the airport) with its Puerto Rican street food, is the one we would go back to in a heartbeat, though the tasty fare is artery-clogging. Fried plantain, barbecue ribs, empanadas and the Puerto Rican staple mofongo, a fried and mashed plantain dish. Prepare for a long nap afterward.The Wyndham and some of the restaurants offer live music on many nights, but traveling with children left us mostly exhausted by the time such things got going.The one cultural stop we will remember is a bit off the beaten path, in Loiza, a small city that is the heart of Afro-Puerto Rican culture. There, the Afro-Puerto Rican artist Samuel Lind has a rambling gallery and workshop where he sells paintings and prints.His works depict everyday scenes and folklore of African descendants who make up a significant part of the island’s population. He is also a generous host, offering soothing tea and the stories behind his works. We were entranced at the large print of a “bomba” dancer, so he walked us across the street to meet Raquel Ayala, the subject and part of a large family of dancers. She has the original painting on a wall.The visit reminded us of the charm of this corner of Puerto Rico, a casual place with rich rewards in easy reach.",sports

"Now that U.S.A. Gymnastics’ latest abuse scandal has escalated into a crisis — more than 80 gymnasts have come forward with sexual abuse allegations against Larry Nassar, a former national gymnastics team doctor who worked in all levels of the sport, including with Olympians, from 1995 to 2015 — the old model of how national sports governing bodies deal with sex abuse has finally been deemed inadequate.What took everyone so long?According to court documents released this month, in response to a request by The Indianapolis Star, which Penny called “a witch hunt,” U.S.A. Gymnastics had complaint files on 54 coaches, from 1996 to 2006. Those coaches were accused of misconduct, including sexually assaulting their athletes, and the federation had empowered itself to investigate those cases before deciding whether to contact law enforcement.In a deposition in one lawsuit brought against U.S.A. Gymnastics by a gymnast charging abuse, here’s Penny’s explanation for his failure to act: “To the best of my knowledge, there’s no duty to report if you are — if you are a third party to some allegation.”So when he learned that Nassar, the team doctor, might have been molesting athletes, Penny and U.S.A. Gymnastics spent five weeks on an internal investigation before reporting Nassar to the authorities. That delay was ingrained in the system.In 2011, U.S.A. Gymnastics received a detailed account of abuse involving Marvin Sharp, a former coach of the year, but Penny and the federation didn’t report it until 2015. There was a lot to be suspicious about.About 15 miles from U.S.A. Gymnastics’ headquarters, Sharp had a photo studio in his Indianapolis gym. On the gym’s website, he offered “portrait sittings and ‘action’ portraits.” Sharp, who coached the Olympian and world champion Bridget Sloan, would ask parents to leave the room for a closed-door, two-hour session when he took pictures of the gymnasts. In many cases, the parents complied.In August 2015, Sharp was arrested after a 14-year-old came forward with claims of abuse. He was later charged with child pornography, child molestation and sexual abuse with a minor. In a raid of Sharp’s house and gym, the police found more than 1,000 digital photos of girls dressed in leotards, adult shirts, bathing suits and dresses, with no underwear and with their genitals exposed. These girls were as young as 5.",sports
"That team, like the hockey players of today, was fighting for more marketing, more development money for younger players and, oh, yes, more compensation. The women’s contract that ensued wasn’t perfect — and its successors remain imperfect today — but it was a giant leap forward for the team, and for a generation of players to come.“The fact that hockey players have had to put up with this for so long is ridiculous,” Foudy said. “Now, sadly, the only way they can get their federation’s attention is to bang them over the head.”The hockey team’s move comes after what the players — young and old — say has been years of struggling to get the federation’s attention, and after years of subsisting on laughably low pay. Their lawyer, John B. Langel, knows the landscape well. He also represented the female soccer players in their 2000 dispute, and he negotiated the collective bargaining agreement the soccer team is currently fighting to improve upon.Still, he said: “The women were paid by U.S. Soccer in 1998 more than what the hockey players are being paid today. Like U.S. Soccer back then, U.S.A. Hockey is saying, ‘We are not going to support the women more than we have in the past, in any significant way.’”So what options do the players have besides a boycott? They could file a discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as the women’s soccer team did last year. Or they could keep negotiating, with no end in sight.Or, with the world championship on U.S.A. Hockey’s doorstep, they could do what they have done: use this perfect opportunity, this maximum leverage, to shine the brightest light they can on their grievances. If it makes the bosses squirm a little at the same time, well, that’s just a bonus.Jeffrey L. Kessler, a lawyer at Winston & Strawn who has represented players’ unions in almost every professional sports league — including the United States women’s soccer team in its E.E.O.C. complaint — said there wasn’t a right way or a wrong way for players to respond to tense contract negotiations, and he warned that each situation was different and required its own tactics. Strikes and boycotts might not be for everyone, he said, no matter how dire the situation might seem.",sports
"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — It is no longer enough for a basketball team to know how many shots a player makes, or even where he or she was standing when a successful shot was released.Sports data is going biometric, tracking players’ heart rates, movements and energy levels to get a better picture of what goes on inside their bodies as they run, jump and even sit on the bench. Furthermore, the device-makers say, the technology can help coaches decide who needs a rest, who needs more work, or who might be most at risk for injury.“Do you have eyes on every single athlete, every single session?” said Calvin Torres, a sports scientist with the tracker and data company Catapult, who has plenty of complaints from old-time coaches who insist that they can make the same assessment with their eyes and their instincts. “If you put a monitor on them, you do.”Catapult is already working with 16 teams in the N.F.L., 15 in the N.B.A. and four in the N.H.L., along with more than a thousand in high school and college, as well as national and pro teams in dozens of countries and in sports that include rowing, rugby and badminton.",sports
"Ennis, from Brampton, Ontario, is playing for his third university and has been playing college basketball for so long that his brother Tyler, who is 6-3 and nearly three years younger, is already a third-year player in the N.B.A., with the Los Angeles Lakers.Dylan started off at Rice. After a year, he transferred to Villanova, where he had to sit out a season because of N.C.A.A. rules. Just before he was eligible to play, he broke his foot. His third year at Villanova, in 2014-15, he was a starter and helped the team win the Big East title and make it to the third round of the N.C.A.A. tournament.But for Ennis, it wasn’t enough. To increase his chances of playing in the N.B.A., he wanted to be a pure point guard, but there was no room for that in Villanova’s system. So Ennis took his bachelor’s degree and transferred yet again, to Oregon, where he is getting a master’s degree in conflict and dispute resolution.He broke his foot last year and ended up playing in only two games. Villanova won the national championship without him.“I’ve had a lot of ups and downs going from school to school, and it’s been hard not getting to leave my blueprints on a program,” he said. “But I had to do what was best for me as a basketball player.”The team calls Ennis O.G., for Original Gangster, a guy who has been around the neighborhood for a long time and can give younger guys advice because he has seen so much. Before the Kansas game, he huddled the team in the tunnel and pointed to a sign on the wall that said, “Phoenix is that way,” referring to the city whose suburb, Glendale, will host the Final Four.“It’s us against the world now,” forward Dillon Brooks recalled Ennis saying. “It’s meant to be that we finish this night in the locker room, holding that trophy up. Don’t waste this moment.”",sports

Just in the last few months, too.Here’s a quick list:On Jan. 25, The Kansas City Star reported that the University of Kansas police were investigating a possible rape of a 16-year-old in the dormitory where the basketball players live, with other male students. Five players were listed as witnesses — Frank Mason III, Mitch Lightfoot, Lagerald Vick, Tucker Vang and Jackson — subjecting Self to a crash course on criminal justice.“From what I have learned,” Self said, “a witness can be many things,” including someone who might or might not have even been at the scene of the crime.During that rape investigation, the police found two glass smoking devices, one with residue, in the junior forward Carlton Bragg Jr.’s room and charged him with possession of drug paraphernalia.

In those few seconds, we saw a producer, [Jordan] Horowitz, celebrate his win for La La Land, then be informed that the wrong movie had been announced, then work hard to get the right team on the stage to accept for Moonlight, including showing the correct card to the camera for proof — and then the best moment of the night, he said that he would wait to present the statue to his friend. That statement made my night — there we saw, from the depths of disappointment at not winning after all, the true human spirit of wanting to be the one to hand the award to his friend.

"Pete Rose’s first three days as a studio analyst for Fox Sports 1 this week suggests that he might be terrific — even if he’s not getting dirty or bowling over catchers.His baseball I.Q. is high, he’s funny and he’s opinionated. Sometimes his views portray him as an old-fashioned old-timer who dislikes some of what he sees in the modern player: pies in the face for a game-winning home run and other celebrations; the lack of defensive and base-running fundamentals; and Troy Tulowitzki’s request to be traded. (“Before you say you want to go elsewhere, try producing!”)Rose especially disliked the former Yankee Jorge Posada’s assertion that Alex Rodriguez should not be in the Baseball Hall of Fame — and that Posada had never told Rodriguez, his former teammate, his belief.“Why wouldn’t he tell him?” Rose asked on the set of “MLB Whiparound,” seated between Kevin Burkhardt, the host, and C. J. Nitkowski, another analyst. “I played with I don’t know how many guys. I would never say anything bad about a former teammate. I wouldn’t get on a stage and bad-mouth a former teammate. Why was he on the show? To sell a book.” Rose added, “You’re better off zipping it.”",sports

"Indeed, there is no point to playing hero ball.Ask Derrick Rose.Rose, the Bulls’ superstar, had faced mountains of criticism from fans and the sports media for putting himself and his health first. Rose has sustained a succession of knee injuries that have tested his physical and mental mettle.In 2012 season, a year after he was the N.B.A.’s most valuable player, Rose tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in the first round of the playoffs. He did not play a game the next season despite having been cleared to play by doctors. The Bulls reached the Eastern Conference semifinals, but Rose chose not to play, ignoring pleas from fans and criticism from the news media.During a news conference last November, Rose, who also tore the meniscus in his right knee early in the 2013-14 season, explained why he was not rushing back to action.“I know a lot of people get mad when they see me sit out,” he said. “But I think a lot of people don’t understand that when I sit out, it’s not because of this year. I’m thinking about long term. I’m thinking about after I’m done with basketball, having graduations to go to, having meetings to go to.”He added, “I don’t want to be in my meetings all sore or be at my son’s graduation all sore just because of something I did in the past.”Brilliant and prophetic. Yet Rose was widely criticized by fans and by reporters, who warned Rose that his legacy would tainted if he failed to play hurt.Three months later, Rose sustained another meniscus tear in his right knee and was ruled out indefinitely, though he returned in April and is playing in his first playoff series since 2012.",sports

"Walter Byers died last week at the age of 93, but his legacy as the first executive director of the N.C.A.A. resonates in virtually every aspect of the multibillion-dollar enterprise of intercollegiate athletics.Byers, at 29, became the first executive director of the N.C.A.A. in 1951. He stepped down in 1987.For 36 years under Byers, the N.C.A.A. began to look like an American fief, not unlike those commanded by sports czars who were his contemporaries, like Primo Nibiolo, head of an international track federation, and Juan Antonio Samaranch, who led the International Olympic Committee.“The good thing that he did was move the N.C.A.A. from a guideline organization to a membership-enforcement system where rules, supposedly, would stick,” said Donna Lopiano, president of the consulting group Sports Management Resources, who was the women’s athletic director at Texas from 1975 to 1992 and chief executive of the Women’s Sports Foundation from 1992 to 2007.“Moving the N.C.A.A. into a membership-governance structure with a system of regulation was his gift,” she said.",sports
"The thing is, painful as it is to admit, there is some truth to Blatter’s hyperbole.Like him or not, and most do not, he has shepherded the women’s game to a place it might never have reached without him.Image Mr. Blatter with the American forward Alex Morgan in 2012. Morgan said he did not recognize her when she was a finalist for the top player award that year. Credit Alexander Hassenstein/FIFA, via Getty ImagesNew investments. New tournaments. New opportunities. In his 17 years as FIFA president, Blatter has overseen an explosion of growth in the women’s game. On his watch, the Women’s World Cup has expanded from 12 teams to 16 teams to 24 this year.Though it took him decades, he did finally bring women onto FIFA’s governing executive committee for the first time, telling the men’s club he leads, again and again, that “the future of the sport lies with women.”Sure, the sport is still dominated by traditional powers like the United States, France, Germany and Brazil, and by early adopters like Sweden and Norway.But this year’s tournament will include eight debutante nations, including Spain, the Netherlands, Thailand and Ivory Coast. That’s a third of the field. It would be hard to argue to those squads that some portion of the much-maligned FIFA development money — funds that people routinely accuse Blatter of passing out as bribes — had not been used to develop women’s teams where they never existed before.Blatter is an imperfect and often reviled hero in this story. His list of cringeworthy sexist remarks is as long as the list of corruption scandals that have dotted and stained his presidency. In one of his creepier comments, he suggested that women’s players market themselves better by wearing tighter shorts because “female players are pretty.”",sports
"Announcers for perennially bad teams usually find ways to maintain their interest and avoid cynicism. Longevity, even with a bad team, is part of the formula for making a broadcaster beloved in local markets. When the Seattle Mariners played in their first postseason in 1995 after a largely dismal franchise history, their announcer Dave Niehaus told me, “I’ve never suffered, never been depressed.”To him, the Pacific Northwest was Valhalla. Why be anywhere else?Similarly, Lefebvre and Denny Matthews, the Royals’ radio announcer since their inception in 1969, said they were never overwhelmed by the team’s drought.“It was kind of a dead time,” Matthews said on Tuesday. “But my tack was that I always go to the ballpark and hope that both teams play well. Then you have a good broadcast. That doesn’t always work out. Sometimes only one team plays well. Sometimes neither of them do. In bad times, you might win 60 or 70 games, and some of them will be good broadcasts. I never let a team’s record bring me down.”Still, he conceded, it feels different inside the stadium when a team wins. “There’s more enthusiasm,” he said. “You can feel the stadium vibrating.”Lefebvre, whose father, Jim, was the 1965 National League rookie of the year, said it was easier to call a winning team. “You can call, ‘Ball one, strike one,’ all game and there’ll be pats on my back about how great I was because I was delivering good news,” he said. Describing the Royals’ losing seasons, he added, was educational.“I had to learn more about the players,” he said. “What they were working on with coaches. What players needed to do to make them better so it might come to fruition right before our eyes. I went deeper, learning more about the game from a coaching and player development perspective. I’ve been lucky to have managers and general managers who let me filter the information without revealing secrets.”He added: “I never considered leaving because of wins or losses. In my little world, all those losing years made me a better broadcaster. Denny and Fred used to talk to me about the mid-’70s and 1980s and how this town will fall in love with this team if it wins again. A part of me wanted to see that.”Thanks to players like center fielder Lorenzo Cain, Lefebvre is getting his wish.“Everybody,” Cain said in the Royals’ clubhouse, “is loving K.C. baseball now.”",sports

(She will turn 40 next month, when she will also be playing in her fifth World Cup, in Canada.)It was long before she was named the captain of the national team in 2008, and before she earned 305 caps, which means she played in 305 international games for her national team — and that’s more than all but one player in soccer history.",sports
"“Now, he’s 95 percent moving in the perfect direction, and he’s learned that playing harder isn’t always playing better,” Storen said. “It’s parallel to golf. You get to the last drive on the 18th tee box and say, ‘I’m going to hit my best drive of the day, and I’m going to swing really hard,’ and that ball is going to hit every tree possible. The key is not riding that emotional roller coaster, and Bryce has learned to do that.”Schu, the hitting coach, said Harper’s excellence had been contagious.“When you’re hitting .330 and hitting home runs it lifts the whole team,” he said. “I don’t care who you are, or if you have a personality, or no personality.”There’s no sense of when he will peak, either. One of the songs Harper has chosen for his at-bats at Nationals Park is Frank Sinatra’s “The Best Is Yet to Come.” But while the Yankees would never admit it, I’ll bet they can imagine him walking to the plate to Sinatra’s “New York, New York” instead.Harper won’t be a free agent until after the 2018 season, but his agent is Scott Boras, and Boras has been known to send a player or two to New York if the price is right. Which it usually has been, especially when the Yankees need a lift.When Harper was on the cover of Sports Illustrated at 16, he told the magazine that two of his goals in baseball were to play in Yankee Stadium and to do it in pinstripes.When I reminded Lerner, one of the Nationals’ owners, of those comments this week, he laughed.“Every 16-year-old kid says that,” he said.But not every 16-year-old kid is Bryce Harper. And what Bryce Harper wants, Bryce Harper seems to get.",sports
"Fox’s acquisition of Open rights was a bit of a shock. NBC wanted to retain them and thought it had. So did ESPN. According to a Golf Digest article, the presentation by NBC officials to the United States Golf Association in June 2013 was a “home run,” including an appearance on the network’s behalf by Arnold Palmer. NBC and ESPN were planning to double what they were paying.But by August, that equation had changed. The U.S.G.A. saw even bigger money coming from Fox and a promise of innovation. Randy Freer, then the co-president of Fox Sports, sounded a bit snide as he celebrated Fox’s first golf deal, saying, “We think the U.S. Open can once again be the pre-eminent golf championship in the world” — implying that its status had diminished during NBC’s tenure.Johnny Miller, NBC’s lead golf analyst, told The Associated Press at the time: “I guess the money was more important than the performance. No way they can step in and do the job we were doing. It’s impossible. There’s just no way.”But that was nearly two years ago. Fox set about building its golf infrastructure, and last week, NBC made a 12-year deal to carry the British Open, starting in 2017, replacing ESPN.The United States Open coverage starts Thursday and Friday from noon to 8 p.m. Eastern on Fox Sports 1 and moves to the Fox broadcast network from 8 to 11 p.m. Jordan Spieth and Tiger Woods are among the golfers expected to be finishing their rounds in prime time Thursday.On Saturday, Fox will start its eight-hour day at 2 p.m., and it will wrap up its final-round coverage on Fox from 2 to 10:30 p.m. A playoff would be held Monday at 2:30 p.m. on Fox.At the 18th-hole tower, the network’s announcing crew will be led by Joe Buck and Greg Norman, pairing someone known for baseball and football, but not golf, and a former golf star new to announcing.

"Why is U.S. women’s soccer still fighting to exist? Part of the problem is FIFA. The sport’s embattled world authority and the national federations with a voting interest in the organization have refused to provide women with an equal playing field, quite literally: This year’s World Cup, in Canada, will be played on artificial turf. That decision prompted a group of female players — 84 players representing 13 countries — to sue FIFA for gender discrimination (though they withdrew the complaint earlier this year); no professional male player, after all, would be willing to play on artificial turf in any tournament, let alone in the World Cup. (Nor did any male soccer star step in to support or testify on behalf of the female athletes.)Wambach says that Sepp Blatter — the FIFA president who resigned this week after the arrests of nine of the organization’s officials — had several opportunities to install grass fields at no cost and chose not to. The players even tried to compromise, submitting a proposal to play only the final rounds on grass, but FIFA refused to engage with them. In fact, its official response was “There’s no Plan B.” This was typical of Blatter, who called himself the “godfather of women’s soccer” on account of the sports’s relative rise during his 17-year tenure, but he is better remembered for announcing his strategy to improve women’s soccer with “tighter shorts.” And according to an internal survey from FIFA, only 23 percent of its 177 member associations have dedicated staff members for women’s soccer, and only 7 percent of coaches and 10 percent of referees globally are women. It’s especially disheartening when you consider that the tens of millions of dollars that FIFA officials are accused of siphoning off in bribery and graft could have supported a women’s professional league for years.If women’s professional leagues in the United States have struggled in part because of FIFA’s gender problems, they haven’t been helped by their own, at times odd, leadership. Just before the Women’s World Cup in 2011, several Women’s Professional Soccer teams declared bankruptcy; by the league’s final season, one team had abandoned it entirely. The Florida-based magicJack franchise — previously the Washington Freedom, renamed by its co-owner, the tech entrepreneur Dan Borislow, after the USB phone-jack device on which Borislow made his fortune — had most of the stars of the national team (including Wambach, Rapinoe and Hope Solo) on his payroll. But other players filed a complaint with the players’ union alleging that they were subjected to unpredictable treatment and abuse. According to the complaint, Borislow insisted on being called “Daddy.” He was eventually banned by the team’s executive committee from attending magicJack games, and the five remaining owners voted to terminate the franchise. (The league folded several months later.) But Borislow kept his roster, the best players in women’s soccer, as an exhibition team. You couldn’t really blame his top-tier talent from exiting the professional league; Borislow, for all his faults, was the only team owner who actually treated athletes like stars, supplying them with real salaries and luxury condos.Sponsors and advertisers, too, have failed to show up in numbers anywhere close to men’s soccer. More than 400 million people worldwide saw at least part of the women’s 2011 Cup. These figures lag behind the men’s cup, the most widely watched sporting event in the world — nearly a billion people tuned into the final alone in 2010 — but the ad revenues lag much further behind: The 2011 Cup brought in just $5.8 million, while the men’s cup in 2014 netted $1.4 billion. Fox Sports, which is carrying this year’s World Cup, says it has already tripled 2011’s revenues, but the numbers are still far apart. This imbalance trickles down to the prize money as well. The German team that won the men’s tournament in 2014 took home $25 million more than the Japanese women’s team that won in 2011.If there’s an analogue for the plight, and potential, of women’s soccer today, it’s women’s tennis in the 1970s. At the time, women had no professional circuit to speak of. When women were allowed to play in tournaments, the pioneering champion Billie Jean King recalled in a recent interview, they were paid an eighth of the prize money that men were.",sports

"The last American women’s team to win the World Cup was the 1999 team, which defined a remarkable era of women’s sports in the United States and embodied the success of Title IX. For an entire generation, it defined what women’s sports should be and could be.At that World Cup final, the Rose Bowl was packed with 90,000-plus fans. About 40 million Americans tuned in. Brandi Chastain scored the winning goal on a penalty kick and ripped off her jersey and flexed — an image of girl power that resonated around the world.Slide ShowMidfielder Megan Rapinoe said that, at times, she wished that today’s American team wasn’t constantly measured against that 1999 team. It’s partly why this squad wants to win this championship so much, she said.“If we win this, then everybody can stop comparing us,” she said. “We’re not them. But we’re here because of them.”This whole month during the World Cup, though, it has been hard to shake them. The 1999 team has been everywhere. Julie Foudy, a former midfielder, is an ESPN analyst for the World Cup. Tony DiCicco, the 1999 team coach, is calling the games on Fox Sports, many times criticizing Coach Jill Ellis as he offers how he would do things.An ESPN documentary called “The 99ers” has been aired at least a half-dozen times, as far as I can count. On the day of one recent showing, Foudy posted on Twitter about her memories of the World Cup victory, with the ’99 goalkeeper Briana Scurry and Kate Markgraf (the former Kate Sobrero) chiming in about how wonderful it was to win back then.“Um, we’d make a good documentary, too,” Krieger said with a laugh.Don’t get them wrong — these ’15ers on the field for the United States appreciate all that the ’99ers have done for women’s sports and soccer in America. But if they don’t win the final on Sunday — in which they will play either England or Japan — it will be four more years of waiting and wondering if they can ever live up to a nearly unattainable standard set by pioneers.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyIf the Americans lose on Sunday, by the next World Cup it will be 20 years since the United States team’s last title in the tournament. It’s not exactly the Cubs’ drought in the World Series. In some ways, it’s worse.Because the longer the United States takes to win another World Cup, the more the pressure to win it will grow and the holier the 1999 team will become, which seems impossible because those ’99ers were beatified as soon as Chastain nailed that final penalty kick.PhotoBut today’s team will remind you, albeit very gently, that winning the World Cup is not as easy as it was 16 years ago.“The game has changed,” Krieger said. “Other countries have caught up.”In 1999, there were 16 teams in the World Cup, expanded from 12 in the previous tournament. Now there are 24, with improved teams like England, which has made the semifinals.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It came down to penalty kicks, and if China ’s Liu Ying didn’t aim for the right corner of the net, and if Scurry didn’t leap in that direction to bat the ball away, it would be Chinese players, not these Americans, who might be talking about the looming legacy of the ’99ers.Just like that, the myth of the American ’99ers never happens.Then, maybe, this United States team wouldn’t be here, as Rapinoe said. And then these Americans wouldn’t have had the chance to make it to the quarterfinals and to the semifinals, where they played more freely and with more fire, pushing forward, just like the ’99ers did.On Tuesday, as the giant scoreboard here at Olympic Stadium read, 2-0, the Americans celebrated by leaping atop each other in a big pile and pumped their fists and hugged each other and played to the crowd by raising their hands to encourage more cheers. It was as if they had won it all. But there is one more game to go.One more game until they can step out of the ’99ers’ shadow and — finally — into their own sun.“We didn’t come here just to make the final,” said midfielder Carli Lloyd, who scored on Tuesday. “We came here to win it.”She added, “I’m feeling very confident that we will win it.”",sports

I have no idea, I really don’t. This league is for the kids. Always has been. But someone did something crazy to ruin it. It’s devastated everybody.”Nothing ruins youth sports like adults acting crazy.

"The get-rich commercial messages of the fantasy sports leaders DraftKings and FanDuel have inundated the airwaves as no advertising category has in recent memory, suffocating almost any other advertiser except for the irksome 1-877-Kars4Kids band.Since August, Draft Kings has plowed $107.5 million into commercials, and FanDuel has paid out $85.8 million, according to iSpot.tv, which tracks advertising spending.In one three-week stretch during the summer, ads from the fantasy sports companies appeared every 90 seconds on national networks. In the month that ended Sept. 15, they outspent the pizza and beer industries in pursuit of more people to play their contests.

"Hard by the High Line, in a vintage industrial building with a Romanesque arch, lights flash on powerful computers in row after row of metal cabinets and cages. Power lines connect the equipment to diesel generators on the roof. Cables route data through the building to conduits beneath New York City streets.This is one small corner of the Internet, unremarkable except for the confluence of two facts: Sports betting is largely illegal in the United States. And this Manhattan building, on 10th Avenue in Chelsea, is one node in a vast network used by a major offshore sports book — ever faster, ever more sophisticated and harder to track or regulate.The network is traversed by United States customers of pinnaclesports.com, a hugely successful Internet sports-gambling company with headquarters until recently in a shopworn hotel in the tiny Caribbean island nation of Curaçao. The unlikely chief of Pinnacle Sports is a granddaughter of a former North Dakota governor who famously engaged in a bit of Cold War diplomacy with Nikita S. Khrushchev.For years, offshore sports books like Pinnacle have used technology and other means to keep prosecutors at bay. In the United States, field agents are arrested, money is forfeited and the illegal gambling rings are seemingly dismantled. Yet they rise again, with different street soldiers and a new arsenal of deception. The one constant is the Internet, which allows for the electronic brain of these sports books to evolve, beyond the reach of American prosecutors.",sports
"Rueil-Malmaison, France — MY family has a problem with time.It isn’t so much an issue with making time or finding time or being on time. And it certainly doesn’t have anything to do with killing time, flying time or having a good time.No, our family’s problem with time is simpler: We think it’s wrong.Specifically, we think French time is incorrect for all but a few weeks each year. The two exceptions — those weeks when the time is right, you might say — come in late March and in late October. What happens then? Well, in the spring the United States begins daylight saving time several weeks before most of Europe, while in the autumn — this week, in fact — most of Europe ends daylight saving time a week before the United States. Admittedly, some might find this revelation irrelevant, but let me assure you: For airline pilots, trans-Atlantic travelers and the significant number of American expatriates in Europe, these glorious weeks are God’s time.Consider: For those of us living in France while, say, our mothers remain in New York, a five-hour time difference instead of six means a phone call made on the way to school pickup syncs perfectly with Grandma’s morning tea instead of perfectly with Grandma’s morning shower (right idea, wrong time). Yes, we are still roughly 3,599 miles from New Rochelle, N.Y., but for a few days the distance feels much smaller.Another plus, according to a friend, is that weeks like these are a gift for live-streaming the late N.F.L. game that he said usually starts at 2:30 a.m. — way too late to justify to his wife —but now kicks off just 30 minutes past 1, which is, I’m told, much more palatable.",sports
"The law does not define what constitutes gambling, instead targeting the use of payment systems, like credit cards or electronic fund transfers, used to finance the games. The exemption for fantasy sports does not legalize them, only that using banks and electronic payments to participate in a game does not run afoul of this particular law.And in an interesting twist, the statute also exempts securities transactions, perhaps showing that Wall Street trading is not really all that far from Las Vegas casinos.Another federal law that takes aim at gambling is the Wire Act, adopted in 1961 at the urging of then-Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy as a means to fight the bookmaking operations of crime syndicates, such as the Mafia. It prohibits using a “wire communication facility” for the transmission of bets or wagers “on any sporting event or contest.” The statute has a safe harbor allowing a bet if it was legal both where it was placed and received, which means state law can determine whether there was a violation.Another statute focusing on organized crime’s involvement in betting is the Illegal Gambling Business Act, adopted in 1970. The law makes it a crime to operate an “illegal gambling business” that involves at least five people, and is in operation for more than 30 days or has gross revenue of $2,000 a day. The statute is broader than the Wire Act by reaching any form of gambling, and like other federal laws, it relies on state law to determine whether the wager was illegal.Other laws dependent on state gambling laws to prove a federal offense include the Travel Act and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, better known as Rico.The fantasy sports companies could come within the federal gambling statutes if their operations run afoul of a state law. Participating in daily fantasy contests is banned in five states: Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, and Washington. Last Friday, the Nevada attorney general issued a memorandum to the Gaming Control Board declaring that daily fantasy sports “constitute gambling games, sports pools, and/or lotteries,” and therefore the companies are subject to the licensing requirements under state law. Of course, Nevada has a stake in limiting competition for the sports books at its casinos, a major source of revenue for them.Offering participation in a daily fantasy contest to residents of states that view it as gambling does not necessarily mean the companies are violating state law. But the F.B.I. may be trying to build a case by looking at where the participants are coming from to see if the states prohibit them from doing so.",sports
"Greenberg Traurig, a law firm hired by the daily fantasy sports company DraftKings to investigate allegations that a DraftKings employee used insider information to win $350,000 at the rival website FanDuel, found no wrongdoing, according to a two-page summary that DraftKings released Monday.John Pappalardo, a former United States attorney for Massachusetts, led the inquiry, which concluded that the employee, Ethan Haskell, a midlevel content manager, had inadvertently released data about DraftKings contestants’ lineups but was unable to use that information in the FanDuel contest. The summary noted that Haskell did not receive the information until 40 minutes after he had to submit his lineup on FanDuel.DraftKings declined to say whether the law firm was investigating allegations that two other employees had access to nonpublic data.",sports
"More than a week ago, Haskell admitted on a blog post that he had released “player owned percentages” — by mistake, he said — before all the lineups for the third week of N.F.L. games were locked up. The data showed which players — included in more than 400,000 entries — were most commonly selected in lineups submitted to the site’s Millionaire Maker contest.That week, he won $350,000 on the rival FanDuel site, but DraftKings said he had done so without benefit of inside information. He also won one of 120 seats at FanDuel’s $12 million World Fantasy Football Championship. There he will have the opportunity to win a $3 million first-place check, and he is guaranteed at least $20,000 for showing up, even if he finishes last.Haskell’s big win followed a hot streak in August, when he finished in the top 10 of 13 Major League Baseball contests, including one contest, with a $25 buy-in, in which he beat nearly 13,000 others to win $50,000, according to the website Larry Brown Sports.Cory Albertson, one of the most successful players in the short history of daily fantasy sports, said that he had long pushed both companies to develop a way to regulate themselves. He has a master’s degree in business administration from Notre Dame and invests more than $10 million annually in one-day fantasy sports. Even though daily fantasy sports operate under an exemption to the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, which outlawed online poker and sports betting, Albertson said that fantasy sites were a form of gambling and that he believed they should be regulated.“When there are no internal controls to keep your employees in check in terms of what they’re doing, it’s understandable that many of them would become preoccupied with trying to also just win money playing fantasy sports,” Albertson said. DraftKings and FanDuel are each valued at more than $1 billion and have begun incessant and costly television advertising campaigns to persuade viewers that anyone with an interest in sports can become a millionaire. The networks and sports leagues so far have been stalwart investors or willing partners in sponsorship agreements.Neither company, however, has turned a profit.It is unclear whether the scandal will slow the companies’ momentum. Last week, DraftKings and FanDuel both posted their first profitable Sundays of the season in their guaranteed prize games, giving out $39.8 million in winnings but taking in $43.6 million in entry fees, according to SuperLobby, an independent site tracking the industry’s guaranteed-prize games.“If you are going to purport you are a billion-dollar business, and advertise on billboards and televisions throughout the country, you need to act like a billion-dollar business,” said Marc Edelman, a law professor at Baruch College and Fordham University and an expert on fantasy sports. “And that includes, among other things, putting in place very sophisticated firewalls and controls to prevent these types of instances from happening in the first place.”",sports
"For the playoffs, though, Citi Field will be packed, with the most expensive tickets of the stadium’s whole life span reserved for Mets fans (and others) who seemingly just noticed that Queens hosts a baseball team. But the real noise comes from those upper deckers, the ones who were there all along. Citi Field will be packed, but let’s not kid ourselves: It’ll mostly be packed with people who weren’t there during the lean times.Not up top, though. There is devotion to the game itself, rather than the “stadium experience,” up there as well. The amenities in the upper deck are always more sparse: No ordering from your seat up in Section 538, no sir. There are fewer concessions, fewer restrooms, fewer distractions to keep the kids occupied — something many stadiums have begun to offer in our short-attention-span world.This keeps you glued to your seat, and to the game, in a way that the amenities of sitting courtside never can. You’re not there for anything other than to watch the game. By sitting farther away, you are in fact more connected to the game itself.And there is a camaraderie up there, a shared experience of being the forgotten fans — often you can’t even see the video board, or your view is blocked by a big concrete plank — and sometimes it’s as if you are watching the game from an entirely different location from where it’s happening, just you and your seatmates.I went to a basketball game once on election night, and because cellphone coverage is so much worse in the bleachers, none of us knew what had happened until we left the arena. When the first to finally get a signal updated the others on the election news, it was as if we were explorers from a distant land, all encased in the same small shuttle, back from the same journey. You are watching the game in a massive stadium, with thousands of other people. But up there, it feels like just you and your friends, even if they’re strangers.The next month of sports is generally the most riveting of the calendar year: the World Series, the start of the N.B.A. and N.H.L. seasons, college football and the N.F.L. Every game will have a differing roster of fans who catch the camera’s eye, closer to the action.But the real stories will be in the upper deck, from the ones who were there all along.

"Mike Groh began recruiting Altee for Alabama during Altee’s sophomore season. He visited the family’s home and went to church with them. Even after Altee broke his ankle and missed his junior season, Groh stayed connected.“I wholeheartedly believed in Altee,” Groh said during a telephone interview. “Not only athletically, but the kind of person that he was and the character that he showed.”I could tell that Groh was holding back tears.“I just believed that this is the kind of kid that does well at Alabama,” he said.But Groh never got to be at Alabama with Tenpenny. After Tenpenny signed with the Crimson Tide, Groh left the program to take a job with the Chicago Bears as the wide receivers coach. Tenpenny could have left like the new employee who sees the boss who hired him suddenly leave the company.“I feel like things could have been different if I hadn’t left,” Groh said. “I think I could have been somebody there for him, who understood the kid, and the things that were important to him.”Tenpenny wanted more playing time and thought he could get it elsewhere. He transferred from Alabama after two seasons as a reserve running back. He landed at U.N.L.V., where he was suspended by a new coach for missing team obligations. He then went to Nicholls State and was dismissed after the firearm episode.“It just breaks my heart that he didn’t get to fulfill his dreams,” Groh said Saturday. “In my heart, I believe that he was meant for better than the way it finished.”",sports

"John S. Kiernan, a lawyer for FanDuel, said in a statement: “Today’s advisory opinion by the attorney general of Texas is founded on a misinterpretation of the law and misunderstanding of the facts about fantasy sports. Fantasy sports has always been a legal contest of skill in Texas.”Attorneys general in New York and Illinois have already said that daily fantasy sports are not legal under their state laws, prompting FanDuel and DraftKings to initiate costly and probably lengthy litigation in both states. With Texas accounting for more than 5 percent of those companies’ players, it means the companies are at risk of losing more than 25 percent of their customers, according to Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, a research firm focused on the gaming industry.New York, with more than 1.2 million customers, is the largest market, and the companies will lose a combined $35 million to $40 million annually, according to Eilers. Illinois is its third-largest market, with 6.7 percent of the industry’s customer base.Last week, John Treadwell, Vermont’s assistant attorney general, said the games were illegal in his state, while Maryland’s attorney general asked the State Legislature to revisit a 2012 law that made fantasy sports legal, but without first conducting a referendum.“Legally, these fantasy sports sites will have to go at it state after state after state,” said the Rev. Richard McGowan, a gaming expert and an associate professor in the economics department at Boston College. “Now there are certain states, like Massachusetts, that are going to be friendlier than others, but FanDuel and DraftKings are really going to have a tough time on their hands if they have to defend themselves in each state.”The New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, in particular, appears to have dug in for a long legal battle. By concluding the games constituted gambling, he highlighted the conflicted relationships that major sports leagues had with daily fantasy sports while opposing legalized sports betting.He has since amended his lawsuit and wants FanDuel and DraftKings to give back the hundreds of millions they have made in the state and pay a stiff penalty for running what he contends are illegal gambling operations.",sports

Zimmerman’s photo disappeared from the Elementz website last week.As for Neal, the Green Bay Packers linebacker, Sly described him as a close friend. Neal went to Merrillville High School in Indiana, about a 90-minute drive from where Sly went to high school. In the documentary, Sly said that he had spent about six weeks in Green Bay and that Neal, who served a four-game suspension for doping in 2012, had introduced him to about half the team.None of this amused Neal.“I’m sure you saw how pissed off Peyton Manning was about somebody coming out with false accusations,” he told reporters last week. “So if you want to piss me off, that’s one thing.

"Revelations of corruption in international sports have become dismally common — in the Olympic Games, in cycling, in soccer and now in track and field.A report released Thursday by the World Anti-Doping Agency painted a dismal picture of top officials in the ruling body of global track and field, the International Association of Athletics Federations, helping conceal doping or blackmailing athletes who were caught. What is dismaying is that it is not simply a case of greedy officials harvesting illegal payments, like those in soccer’s ruling body. In track and field, the officials’ behavior directly undermined fair competition.The report released Thursday was actually the second part of the findings of a yearlong investigation by an independent commission of the agency into allegations first made by a German public broadcaster of a state-sponsored doping program in Russia. The first part of the report, issued in November, focused on that program, which involved athletes, coaches, trainers, doctors and the secret services, and led to Russia’s suspension from global competition.The second installment of the report said that well before the international agency launched its investigation the track and field association knew the extent of Russia’s involvement. Much of the report focused on Lamine Diack, the Senegalese who led the association until last year, who is under criminal investigation in France along with close aides and his two sons.",sports

When the Deflategate story broke after last year’s A.F.C. championship game between the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts, he found himself fixated on it, yearning to dig into it from a scientific point of view.On the off chance you have spent the last year on Mars, Deflategate refers to the scandal that ensued after the Colts accused the Patriots of deflating their footballs to give quarterback Tom Brady an unfair edge — an accusation that the N.F.L. and its commissioner, Roger Goodell, ultimately determined was probably true.“Of course, I thought of the Ideal Gas Law right away,” Leonard says, “but there was no data to test it.” Although the N.F.L. had measured the pounds per square inch (p.s.i.) of the Patriots’ footballs at halftime after the Colts complained — under the rules, game balls must be inflated to pressures ranging from 12.5 to 13.5 p.s.i. — it had not released any numbers.The Ideal Gas Law, in case you are wondering, sets out the expected behavior of gases under certain conditions, like changes in temperature or volume. For instance, gases contract when they are in cold air and expand when they are in warmer temperatures. “I’m always looking for real life examples for my students,” Leonard says.

The aggrieved Maradona took the shot but sent it over the goal. His knees bent. He clutched the back of his neck with both hands. He despaired operatically. The Barcelona crowd was not sympathetic. He was having a bad start in his new town, and he knew it.Gentile’s close-order combat was part of the gritty Italian defense catenaccio, the chain or bolt. Italy had not won a World Cup since 1938 and was mocked by fans of other teams, who said that Italy’s methodical defenders did not know what to do with the ball once they stripped it from marauders, but here they responded with stunning counterattack, with skill and speed beyond my comprehension.I had played soccer badly at Jamaica High in New York in the mid-’50s and had been touched by the classic documentary, “Goal!,” about the 1966 World Cup in England. My most recent exposure to the sport had been to watch the aging Cosmos, former stars ending their days like beached whales on a foreign shore. I had never imagined the sport could be conducted at such a pace, bing-bing-bing, like a pinball on speed.When Italy and Argentina were attacking and counterattacking, I was not able to follow the touches, the names and numbers, as they moved over more than 100 yards up and down the field. Italy won, 2-1. The hacking of the little bull from Argentina had paid off.“Soccer is not for ballerinas,” Gentile said.After the match I wondered why I found myself charmed by the brash intrusion of the Italians. Perhaps it was a memory of Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, who read the Sunday comics on the radio during a newspaper strike when I was a youngster. Or perhaps I was recalling my neighbors across the street in Queens, who kept homemade wine in casks in the basement and spewed pungent Italian curses in their kitchen; plus, they often fed me a starter bowl of pasta before I headed home for my own supper.

"How sad for USA Track & Field. It has clearly run out of credible coaches.Of all the talented trainers in the United States, USATF, which governs track and field in this country, had to resort to naming Dennis Mitchell to lead its sprint teams at the I.A.A.F. World Relays in the Bahamas last week. That’s the same Dennis Mitchell who tested positive for banned testosterone in 1998, and then defended himself by saying that failed doping test was a result of too much beer and too much sex with his fiancée.Mitchell was innocent, he had shouted for all to hear, insisting that his ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone — a measure used by drug testers to monitor testosterone levels in the body — was natural, even though it was nearly two times the current allowed limit. A USATF panel believed his story, but international officials did not, and Mitchell served a two-year ban.“I feel terribly wronged,” he told The New York Times during the ban. “I feel like this sport owed me more than this.”A decade later, the public learned that Mitchell, a four-time national champion in the 100 meters and an Olympic gold medalist, was not just a stellar performer on the track. He also had been a good actor.",sports
"He was supposed to attend a 20th anniversary party this week for the organization Kick It Out, which campaigns against all kinds of discrimination in soccer. It is likely that he will not be allowed through the door. A letter endorsed by women in the sport went out to the league’s 20 teams last week saying that an apology from Scudamore would not be enough. Something more drastic needed to be done.But the league’s clubs either weren’t listening or didn’t care. The panel investigating the comments contended that the emails were private and that the public should not have seen the contents of them in the first place. In basing its decision on that reasoning, the Premier League acted as if those emails never existed, as if Scudamore had never said all of those demeaning things about women. It’s not as if he said anything racist, right? It was just women he was kicking around.The Premier League’s acting chairman, Peter McCormick, said in a statement, “In these circumstances, and in the light of a previously unblemished record over 15 years of service to the Premier League, the clubs resolved unanimously that no further disciplinary action is required or justified.”In a lame effort to show that it did some investigation, the panel announced that a female executive at the Premier League to whom Scudamore had referred in his emails “was not then and is not now offended by the references.” That amounts to asking someone if she likes her boss — with the boss standing right there. What’s the woman to say when sitting under a spotlight, especially in a culture that we now know abides sexist comments? The league’s inquiry was not exactly an independent report into whether a culture of sexism exists and needs to be eradicated.The old-boy network of the Premier League, which has grown ridiculously rich under Scudamore’s leadership, had spoken.It did not listen to all of the voices — men and women — pressuring Scudamore to resign, including Rachel Brown-Finnis, a goalkeeper for England’s women’s national team, who said Scudamore’s emails were an “insult to all women.” It did not care that the sports and equality minister criticized the emails or that Prime Minister David Cameron allowed that anyone in his cabinet caught exchanging those kinds of emails would not remain on the job.It also snubbed Heather Rabbatts, one of the sport’s most senior female officials in England. She accused Scudamore of overseeing a “closed culture of sexism” that discourages women from getting involved in the sport. And she, unlike the Premier League, might actually do something about it.",sports
"PhotoGolf holes the size of pizzas? Bigger courts and four-point shots in basketball? Two-hand touch instead of tackle football? Tradition and history play an important role in sports, but like anything else, games evolve to keep up with changing times.What rules would you like to see changed in your favorite sports?In the article “In a Hole, Golf Considers Digging a Wider One,” Bill Pennington writes about how some golf leaders want to shake up the sport to attract a younger generation:Golf holes the size of pizzas. Soccer balls on the back nine. A mulligan on every hole. These are some of the measures — some would say gimmicks — that golf courses across the country have experimented with to stop people from quitting the game. Golf has always reveled in its standards and rich tradition. But increasingly a victim of its own image and hidebound ways, golf has lost five million players in the last decade, according to the National Golf Foundation, with 20 percent of the existing 25 million golfers apt to quit in the next few years. People under 35 have especially spurned the game, saying it takes too long to play, is too difficult to learn and has too many tiresome rules. Many of golf’s leaders are so convinced the sport is in danger of following the baby boomer generation into the grave that an internal rebellion has led to alternative forms of golf with new equipment, new rules and radical changes to courses. The goal is to alter the game’s reputation in order to recruit lapsed golfers and a younger demographic.Students: Read the entire article, then tell us …— Is there anything about your favorite sports that bothers you?

"The N.B.A. might have breathed a sigh of relief last week when the Los Angeles Clippers were knocked out of the playoffs. The loss allowed the league to temporarily brush aside the embarrassing Donald Sterling fiasco. Sterling was barred for life by Commissioner Adam Silver and threatened with the forced sale of his team after the release of recordings in which he chided a female friend for associating with black people.But while the Clippers are out, LeBron James is still in. As he tries to win his third straight championship with the Miami Heat, his influence is increasing, and his denunciation of Sterling should challenge N.B.A. owners to do all they can to oust him.James hasn’t issued any threats, and he has steered clear of talk about a boycott. But he has said in the most direct manner that Sterling has forfeited his right to own an N.B.A. franchise.“It doesn’t matter, white, black or Hispanic — all across the races, it’s unacceptable,” James said immediately after Sterling’s racist rants surfaced. “As the commissioner of our league, they have to make a stand. They have to be very aggressive with it. I don’t know what it will be, but we can’t have that in our league.”",sports
"Their accounts are detailed in court documents:On Oct. 30, 2013, two women were partying at Bootsy Bellows, a West Hollywood nightclub, when they met Sharper through a mutual friend. Later, Sharper invited those women to a party and they all left the club together.While in the cab to the party, Sharper told the women he had wanted to make a pit stop at his hotel suite “to pick up something.” The women obliged and accompanied Sharper to his suite. Soon after they walked through the door, Sharper mixed drinks for them, coaxing them to try a liqueur he called Coffee Patron, according to court documents. Within minutes, both women blacked out.Several hours later, one woman woke up naked, with Sharper sexually assaulting her. The other woman woke up, too, and entered Sharper’s bedroom, interrupting the assault. They gathered their belongings and went home, only to wake up four hours later, remembering only portions of the night.A little more than two months later, on Jan. 14, Sharper had returned to Bootsy Bellows for what the police said was a repeat performance. He met two women, and then invited them to another party. According to court documents, he asked them to stop at his hotel suite so he could pick up some narcotics.They walked into the suite. Then came the shots of liquor. They blacked out.Both women woke up several hours later on a pullout couch in the living room. One immediately felt as if she had been sexually assaulted. They left, but ended up sleeping three to four more hours before reporting the incident to the police. Again, their memories of the night were spotty. Neither had any recollection of what happened during the many hours after they drank the shots that Sharper had given them.The next night, Sharper was in Las Vegas at a nightclub, and the script began from the first scene once again: He met two women, invited them and one of their male friends to his hotel room, where he said there would be a party. Shots. Blackouts.One of the women awoke next to Sharper in bed and upon going to the bathroom discovered “visible injuries to her face she could not account for.” Sharper asked her how she was feeling because, he told her, she had vomited the night before. He then offered her sips of a beverage that would make her feel better. The next thing she remembered after taking those sips was Sharper’s sexually assaulting her. The woman still sleeping on the couch woke up and felt as if she too had been assaulted. The male friend regained consciousness when he was at a bar in the hotel lobby. He didn’t know how he got there.",sports

"Hector Santiago of the Los Angeles Angels was sitting at a restaurant table in Glendale, Ariz., in March, holding an orange in his left hand. He formed a circle with his thumb and forefinger, then spread his remaining fingers around the fruit with half an inch between each one. He was demonstrating how he throws his screwball, which is the best in baseball mostly because nobody else has one.The secret, he said, is to exert no pressure with the pinkie or ring finger. As he moved his arm forward in a slow-motion simulation, he pushed hard with his middle finger on the inside of the orange until much of his hand was beneath it, creating a clockwise spin. “Like driving on your right wheels going around a curve,” he said.Earlier that day, in a spring-training game, Santiago, a 26-year-old southpaw from Newark in his fourth season, threw a screwball to the All-Star outfielder Carlos Gomez of the Milwaukee Brewers. His previous pitch, a fastball, hit 94 m.p.h. The screwball approached the plate at 76. The difference in velocity alone would be difficult for a hitter to process, but the clockwise spin on the screwball also caused it to drop precipitously and veer to the left, away from the right-handed Gomez rather than toward him, as a curveball would. Gomez swung mightily and missed. “That pitch was filthy,” he told me later. “I was looking for it. I had it. And it disappeared. Put that guy on ice, man. He’s going to win a lot of games.”A pitcher’s typical menu includes a fastball, a curveball and a changeup as the meat and potatoes, with perhaps a slider, cut fastball or sinker as a side. The screwball is another dish entirely. Those who serve one have typically been looked upon as oddities, custodians of a quirky art beyond the realm of conventional pitching. Over time, the word itself has taken on the characteristics of both the pitch and those who throw it: erratic, irrational or illogical, unexpected. Unlike the knuckleball, which is easy to throw but hard to master, the screwball requires special expertise just to get it to the plate. The successful screwball pitcher must overcome an awkward sensation that feels like tightening a pickle jar while simultaneously thrusting the wrist forward with extreme velocity. Yet the list of master practitioners includes some of baseball’s greats: Christy Mathewson, Carl Hubbell, Warren Spahn, Juan Marichal.",sports
"It was around this time that Lisa Picard, executive vice president of Skanska USA Commercial Development’s Seattle office, heard that Brooks was in the market for office space. Ms. Picard, a runner and cyclist, wanted to build space for Brooks from the ground up. “I said, ‘Let’s get closer to the runner and try to create a trailhead,’ ” said Ms. Picard, who had been vice president for real estate and development at Canyon Ranch, which operates destination health spas and resorts.Image The office is across the street from the Burke-Gilman Trail, which is popular with runners and cyclists. Credit Stuart Isett for The New York TimesMs. Picard and her team narrowed the search to the Fremont and Wallingford neighborhoods, identified a one-acre commercial lot suitable for the project and took their idea to Mr. Weber. Skanska would build a space that would resonate with Brooks, which agreed to a 10-year lease, with the right to renew. “I signed a lease on a building that didn’t exist yet,” Mr. Weber said, something his lawyers said was rare.The project wasn’t entirely seamless. For one, it required moving Brooks employees to a temporary headquarters for 15 months during construction. “No company wants to do a double move, but we had no other option,” he said.There was also a question of space. To build something large enough to accommodate Brooks for at least a decade, Skanska needed the city’s blessing to build 20 feet higher than permitted by zoning. The city ultimately agreed, with the condition that the building meet rigorous environmental standards. These include capturing and reusing at least 50 percent of storm water on the site and using 75 percent less energy than a typical commercial building in the city. (The building is also on track to receive LEED Platinum status, the U.S. Green Building Council’s highest designation for environmental features.)Some of these energy savings will come from the building’s design. A hydronic heating and cooling system, for example, uses circulated water to control the building’s temperature. High windows maximize natural light, while LED lighting and motion sensors further trim energy use.Other savings will come from changes in behavior. Most employees will swap their desktop computers for more efficient laptops and turn off everything at the end of the day. While taking the elevator is an option, a five-story staircase is one of the building’s most prominent features. It’s enclosed in glass and visible from the lobby and the street. The parking garage has a dedicated bike lane and dozens of secure bike spots. First-floor showers make human-powered commutes more feasible, though showers time out after five minutes.“You take all of these things in combination and the environmental impact is significant,” Ms. Picard said.Dashboards throughout the building will broadcast real-time statistics on energy consumption. To further underscore the importance of conserving energy, Skanska commissioned the Seattle-based artist Casey Curran to make a 7-foot-by-8-foot kinetic sculpture for the lobby. The sculpture, which is tied to the building’s energy grid, features brass flowers that gradually change position. When the building is running efficiently, the flowers bloom. When energy use is too high, they wilt.",sports
"When Argentina midfielder Javier Mascherano cracked heads with a Dutch player during a World Cup semifinal last week, millions of soccer fans saw it.From all over the world, they posted comments about it on Twitter and Facebook — the Spanish words for concussion are conmoción cerebral, by the way — and some fans probably held their breath as they watched Mascherano’s reaction to the collision. He staggered for a few steps, as if he had downed one too many cocktails, and collapsed with a zombie’s blank stare.Spectators didn’t need a medical degree to realize that he had hurt his head, and probably his brain, and that someone with a medical degree should properly evaluate him.But then came yet another example of the dysfunction of FIFA, the sport’s world governing body, and how it is apparently indifferent to player safety, given what it has shown at this World Cup: Mascherano spent about two minutes on the sideline before returning for the rest of the match. That’s about four or five minutes before he should have returned, if he had received a proper neurological evaluation to determine the extent of his injury.",sports

"EARTH CITY, Mo. — Finally, football.That was Michael Sam’s mantra Tuesday afternoon when he met a crush of news media that was eager to track the experience of the N.F.L.’s first openly gay player.“I got some hits out there,” Sam said. “It felt good. I haven’t been in pads since the Senior Bowl, so it felt good.”It was shortly after the Senior Bowl when Sam, the Southeastern Conference defensive player of the year at Missouri, disclosed that he is gay. When he was drafted in the final round by the St. Louis Rams, there was speculation that Sam was selected low because he was a “tweener”— too small to play defensive line, too slow to be a linebacker.

"ESPN is such a colossus that it was big news when Michelle Beadle challenged Stephen A. Smith over his misguided remarks on Friday about domestic violence. They are ESPN stars, with nearly three million Twitter followers between them. The ESPN ecosystem is such that any misstep by any of its boldface names can start a digital storm, even if the subject is inane — or Tim Tebow.Domestic violence is anything but silly, though it is difficult to discuss intelligently on a sports debate show like “First Take” on ESPN2 or without an expert or a victim to provide experience and balance. But Smith was riffing Friday on “First Take,” on which he and Skip Bayless are the loudmouthed commentators. Smith was discussing the N.F.L.’s two-game suspension of Ray Rice over allegations that he beat his fiancée, now his wife, in a casino elevator, and Smith suggested that women should avoid provoking men into assaulting them.Staking out a position for a longer punishment for Rice is not brave. Anyone could see that N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell had been too lenient. But then Smith went verbally reckless.“In Ray Rice’s case, he probably deserves more than a two-game suspension, which we both acknowledged,” he said, as Bayless nodded. “But at the same time, we also have to make sure that we learn as much as we can about elements of provocation. Not that there’s real provocation, but the elements of provocation” — at this point, without letting him finish his sentence and as he delved into amateur forensics, you had to wonder which “elements” he was talking about, when women should accept responsibility for being victimized and why those elements do not add up to “real provocation.”",sports
"More than that, Gazprom — which the Russian government owns a majority of — gets access that buys it even more prominence.You might, for example, tune in to a British channel and be greeted by opening titles tying Gazprom to the UEFA Champions League. “We Light Up The Football” goes the slogan. And if any one of four teams — Zenit St. Petersburg in Russia, Schalke 04 in Germany, Red Star Belgrade in Serbia or Chelsea in London — is on the screen, you are can hardly miss the fact that Gazprom is either on the team’s jersey or otherwise is an official sponsor.It is all within the rules binding sports and commerce, which are, these days, full blood brothers. Gazprom owns only one club (Zenit) and therefore does not run afoul of the UEFA rule that was tightened years ago to prevent conflicting interests between cross-party ownership of competing teams in its leagues.And when the Gazprom deal was consecrated with FIFA last fall, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia stood with Gazprom’s chief executive, Alexei Miller, and the president of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, as they signed the official contract.The deal, Putin pronounced, was “important and noble.”“Gazprom is not only the largest gas company in the world, but also one of the most passionate about football,” Miller said. “I am sure this cooperation will improve Gazprom’s reputation and advance our brand awareness to a fundamentally new level on a global scale.”",sports

"In Week 13 of his rookie season, in a game against Baltimore, Griffin was hurt when Ravens defensive end Haloti Ngata slammed into him on a tackle, twisting Griffin’s right knee. He was clearly hurt, but he hopped and hobbled for several plays before leaving the game. The diagnosis was a Grade 1 sprain.Griffin sat out one game, but he played the next two — helping Washington wrap up its first division title in 13 years. Then, in perhaps the most demoralizing moment of his career, Griffin played against Seattle in a wild-card playoff game. Clearly weakened, he became less and less effective as the game and the pain wore on. He should have been taken out, should have taken himself out for the sake of his team and his career.But unlike Rose, Griffin and his team were thinking about the moment. He eventually crumpled to the turf chasing a fumbled snap. And as a result of aggravating his injured knee, Griffin may never be the same player.Griffin had been determined to stay in the game to show leadership and courage. That was all well and good, but his valor has not stopped the Washington fans who once saluted his toughness from calling for him to be replaced, first by Kirk Cousins and then by Colt McCoy.This was what Rose was referring to when he said his injuries — and the fan reaction to them — had shown him what was real. Athletes are mere cogs in a wheel, discarded as soon as they are no longer useful.In April 2012, a year after he was named the N.B.A.’s most valuable player, Rose tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during the opening game of the playoffs. He was cleared to play by team doctors in March 2013 but chose to continue to sit out, even as the Bulls scraped and clawed their way into the conference semifinals without him. He was criticized for not playing in that first-round series against the Nets, which the Bulls won in seven games.Last year he injured his right knee, and tests confirmed that he had torn his meniscus and needed surgery.

"With one hockey game on his résumé, Michaels was tapped by ABC to call the hockey at the Lake Placid Olympics in 1980. With one line, he secured his place in history, giving rise to the miracle-on-ice nickname for the Americans’ victory over the Soviets.Familiar with the Bay Area through his love of geography and his time as a San Francisco Giants announcer, Michaels shifted from baseball to narrating the destruction caused by the earthquake that interrupted the 1989 World Series. And after calling Olympic track and field in 1984 with O. J. Simpson, Michaels spoke to Simpson by telephone three or four times a decade later when he was a suspect in the murders of his wife, Nicole, and her friend Ronald Goldman.“Someone said to me before I wrote this book,” Michaels said, “that your life is like Forrest Gump’s.”Each man had an influential mother. Lila Michaels appeared about a half-dozen times at her son’s high school to tell an administrator that he had a dentist appointment, a ruse to spirit him (and sometimes one or two of his friends) to Santa Anita or Hollywood Park. His mother told The Los Angeles Times in 1988 that she had done that only once, but Michaels said Monday, with a chuckle, “I have witnesses!”As he warmed to the memory of his mother last week, he pushed his chair back from the table.“She was a combination of Phyllis Diller and Joan Rivers,” he said. “She was always the life of the neighborhood, in our apartment building in Brooklyn, our neighborhood in Bellmore and in Los Angeles. My friends just loved her. She was hysterical and did things other mothers didn’t. She told dirty jokes. The other mothers weren’t like my mom.”When asked if she had worked outside the home, Michaels smiled as he recollected her career as a contestant coordinator for game shows in the 1960s and ’70s but said he regretted not having put that in his book.It would have been a neat parallel to his short career in game shows, in which he worked two stints for the producer Chuck Barris sandwiched around a short and unhappy time as the color commentator for Lakers games on the radio in 1967, when there was no color and no commentary.

Bake sales for Calvin. Soup dinners for Calvin. Silent auctions for Calvin.His classmates came up with the saying #CalvinStrong, which soon popped up around the county, on T-shirts, on signs posted along the streets and even on badges that were made and worn by first graders. The principal at Hayden Elementary, Brent Comer, said he didn’t even think the children knew what a hashtag meant, but they thought it was cool, so he decided to order rubber bracelets with the phrase #CalvinStrong, to sell for $2. All of it, again, to raise money for Calvin’s family.“We can moan and groan and be angry and be sad about what happened, but the family wants us to give them positive vibes, so that’s exactly what we’re trying to give them,” said Mr. Comer, who drove with Mrs. Stoner to try to see Calvin right after his injury. “We consider Calvin one of our family, and none of us are thinking about why it happened, or about football, right now. Not yet, at least.”So many other places in the United States recently have gone through situations like this. Small towns. Larger cities. Parts of the country that live for football and parts that don’t. About a month ago, in the span of one week, it was Troy, Ala., then Rolesville, N.C., then Wading River, N.Y. — all places where high school players died after sustaining head injuries playing football.How many more communities will be forced to consider, in the harshest, most personal manner possible, how safe it is for their children to play football?

Maybe not now, but soon.These days here, there hasn’t been much time for introspection.Calvin was injured on Nov. 1, when he and his county youth travel team played in an end-of-season all-star tournament in Columbus, about 30 miles from here. The event lasted two days, with doubleheaders each day.Several witnesses said that Calvin, a wispy running back, was “horse collared” in the first of two games that Saturday, which meant that an opposing player had pulled him down by grabbing the inside of his shoulder pads. One of his teammates and classmates, Raul Ruiz, told me Calvin was later blindsided by one tackle, got up from the ground, then dropped his head and grabbed his face mask, appearing distraught.",sports
"During Game 7 on Wednesday, in the midst of Madison Bumgarner’s magnificent, five-inning relief appearance for the Giants, Reynolds played down the effect of Bumgarner’s pitching nearly 270 innings, citing his size, as if pitchers measuring 6 feet 5 inches and 235 pounds were immune to arm trouble. Another odd moment: Reynolds wondered what Giants starter Tim Hudson had learned about the Royals’ lineup from watching Jake Peavy, the Game 6 starter, without offering context: Peavy was knocked out after one and a third innings. What was Hudson to learn? Don’t do what Peavy did?There is an experience imbalance to the Fox crew. Joe Buck, the play-by-play man, has called many more games than his new partners, and while they are a friendly group, their chemistry needs time to develop, if it ever does. And Reynolds’s and Verducci’s enthusiasm for just being at the World Series, as well as their over-the-moon passion for the concept of a Game 7, was excessive for men with decades of work in baseball.A small aside about Reynolds: If you’re going to talk about your history as a player, be precise. During the series, he claimed that he made his major league debut in 1983 in Kansas City at Kauffman Stadium. Actually, his debut was as a pinch-runner at the Kingdome in Seattle. His first game in the Mariners’ starting lineup came three days later in Kansas City. Second, he said that he broke Royals second baseman Frank White’s streak of Gold Glove awards. Which one? White had a six-year streak that Lou Whitaker broke in 1983. In 1988, Reynolds ended a two-year White streak.If Reynolds skewed his background a bit, however innocently, Fox offered a skewed analysis in Game 5 about Kansas City pitcher James Shields. Ken Rosenthal, a Fox reporter, said Shields had made an adjustment from Game 1 by starting his windup with his hands at his waist, not at his chest. But with nearly every pitch immediately before Rosenthal’s comment, and until the end of the inning, Shields started his windup with his hands at this chest. Twice, Fox used a split screen of Shields from Game 1 and Game 5 to prove the change. But the next inning showed that Shields’s windup started with his hands at his waist only without runners on base.In Game 7, one play illustrated what Fox lost without McCarver’s aptitude for getting ahead of a play. In the fifth, the Royals’ Omar Infante singled off Bumgarner. There was no criticism of Alcides Escobar when he twice squared to bunt or before he laid down a sacrifice. Only as a second-guess did the crew suggest that Escobar was swinging too well to have the bat taken out of his hands, or that it wasn’t the time to bunt, or that Nori Aoki, the next batter, was hitless in 16 at-bats against Bumgarner and 1 for 12 in the series.

I believe we need a different approach.For more than two decades, the National Basketball Association has opposed the expansion of legal sports betting, as have the other major professional sports leagues in the United States. In 1992, the leagues supported the passage by Congress of the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, or Paspa, which generally prohibits states from authorizing sports betting.But despite legal restrictions, sports betting is widespread. It is a thriving underground business that operates free from regulation or oversight. Because there are few legal options available, those who wish to bet resort to illicit bookmaking operations and shady offshore websites. There is no solid data on the volume of illegal sports betting activity in the United States, but some estimate that nearly $400 billion is illegally wagered on sports each year.Times have changed since Paspa was enacted. Gambling has increasingly become a popular and accepted form of entertainment in the United States. Most states offer lotteries. Over half of them have legal casinos. Three have approved some form of Internet gambling, with others poised to follow.",sports
"The Circus Maximus known as the National Football League alighted in London for a game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Jacksonville Jaguars. The league’s many fascinations will be on display: its wonderful athleticism, its stupendous television ratings, and its blithe disregard for the safety of its most valuable commodities, the players.Nearly two weeks ago, a 6-foot-3, 240-pound Redskins linebacker sprinted, spun and drove his knee into the back of Tony Romo, the Cowboys’ quarterback.That hit caused Romo’s back muscles to yank apart so hard that pieces of two vertebrae chipped and fractured in his lower back. That injury, most typically seen in auto or airplane accidents, did not threaten the stability of Romo’s spine.It did result in intense pain. And it takes six to eight weeks to begin to heal.“I’ve had patients on the floor with this,” said the orthopedist John Bendo, a clinical professor at the New York University Langone Hospital for Joint Disease. “Two weeks later? Romo’s still in a lot of pain. A lot. It’s acute.”",sports
"Mr. Silver stated that measures like New Jersey’s were “both unlawful and bad public policy.” That put the N.B.A. and the other leagues back in the courtroom, continuing their suit. Judge Shipp had sided with the leagues in 2013, and earlier this year issued a temporary injunction against the state and the tracks seeking to offer sports betting, making proponents believe he will rule against them again Friday, when he has promised a decision.“Legally nothing changes; aesthetically, everything changes,” said Marc Edelman, a professor of law at the Zicklin School of Business at Baruch College, who has followed the case. The teams’ forays into fantasy game sites, he said, “shows that the league owners are willing to take money directly from online gaming, and gives the owners a strong incentive to foster a legal environment that is favorable to at least certain kinds of online gaming.”“We are dancing ever so much closer to traditional sports gambling becoming legal,” he said.Lawyers for the state and the racetracks that want to offer sports betting seized on the leagues’ investment in fantasy leagues. Ronald Riccio, a lawyer for the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association, accused them of “an effort to have your cake and eat it too.”“These fantasy games are fantasy in name only,” Mr. Riccio said. “They are wagers that get placed based on the performance of individual players in the leagues’ games. That’s not fantasy. The leagues are sponsoring it, they are endorsing it, they have their own platforms for it, their players are participating in it.”He disparaged the leagues’ arguments that sports betting would be a hardship on the leagues.“The only hardship to the leagues is that there’s going to be another competitor,” Mr. Riccio told Judge Shipp. “That’s not a hardship. That’s unfair competition, and that’s illegal.”In his arguments Thursday, a lawyer for the leagues did not address Mr. Silver’s shift in favor of sports betting, which many proponents had proclaimed a “game changer,” or the fantasy leagues. Instead, he argued that New Jersey’s attempt to work around the federal statute still violated it.The Democratic-led Legislature and Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, have pushed sports betting as a way to help bail out Atlantic City and the state racetracks, which have both been ailing for several years.",sports

"Photographing sports is as much about capturing the action as it is about presenting the athlete. These days, I’m off the sidelines for many assignments, instead working in studio environments for editorial and commercial projects. Athlete portraiture is all about showing the athlete’s personality, strengths, weaknesses, motivation, intensity, commitment. But for the Powder Sports series, a personal project, I wanted to step away from all that.PhotoMy initial approach was to shoot athletes in silhouette during action moments exaggerated by colored powder that had been spread on the equipment. With each unidentifiable player, I hoped, the focus would shift from the athlete to his or her interaction with the ball, the bat, the golf club. The powder was there to represent the anticipation, the energy and the power behind each frame.But nothing ever goes as planned. As I reviewed the initial images, I felt my focus was torn between the subject and the sport. So, in collaboration with my retoucher, George McCardle, we started stripping down the images. First, we shot the scene with all elements covered in powder, and then, in postproduction, we removed all elements except the powder. All that remains is an ethereal sports moment, full of energy and vibrancy.",sports
"He envisions a three-credit seminar in conjunction with an “internship” — a semester on the team. The course could require players to keep logs of what they do each day and write a self-evaluation on career-building skills. “Athletes sometimes don’t realize the value of the skills they’re learning,” Dr. Coplin said. “But employers do.” He argues that their skill set — competitiveness, drive, the ability to work toward a common goal and take responsibility — is particularly valuable in sales and business management. Another idea for the class: an Excel lesson in which a player tracks his performance using trend lines and percentage change.One supporter, Andy Geiger, a former Ohio State athletic director, recalled cajoling athletes to study simply to keep their grade-point average high enough to remain eligible to play. A degree in sports, he said, could close the enthusiasm gap.“Think of the academic overlay,” added Karen Weaver, a sport management professor at Drexel University. “I’m training for a sport and I have to learn the science behind the muscles I’m using. I’m injured and I have to study and report on my rehab plan. It’s the ultimate personalized education.”Such a hands-on education might also help players achieve what is, for many, their ultimate career goal: joining the professional ranks. Most won’t make it, but their fate, Dr. Pargman says, is not unique to sports: “Everyone who wants to be a doctor doesn’t get into medical school.”Con: A Needless AccommodationWith higher education already facing criticism that it is beholden to big-time sports, Josephine T. Potuto, a University of Nebraska law professor and N.C.A.A. faculty representative, worries that a sports major would be another example of the tail wagging the dog. “There comes a point when you are turning higher education into a pretzel to accommodate the high-revenue, fan attention-grabbing two sports,” she said.A major sticking point is the illustrious history of academic fraud that long predates the University of North Carolina scandal. Dexter Manley, a former Oklahoma State defensive end, told a Senate committee in 1989 that he was functionally illiterate during college. A smattering of universities used to offer courses entitled “Varsity Basketball” or “Varsity Football,” graded on attendance. Coach Bill Snyder of Kansas State — surprise — gave nearly all his players an A, and Jim Harrick Jr. was fired as assistant basketball coach of the University of Georgia; one of the reasons was a final exam he gave to his “Coaching Principles and Strategies of Basketball” class with multiple-choice questions like “How many points does a 3-point field goal account for?”Currently, 20 colleges are being investigated by the N.C.A.A. on suspicion of academic fraud, according to a report last month in The Chronicle of Higher Education.",sports

"This sort of bulk honoring draws loyal fans, so why not stage a bunch of these events? On the other hand, all these special days seem a little calculated in the midst of the down cycle in which the Yankees now find themselves. It may not be the worst of times in the Bronx, but two straight failures to reach the postseason have left a lot of Yankees fans feeling a little angry and disoriented. So enter the recent, happier past as a way of changing the subject, at least for a little while.“You can say that it’s a vivid reminder of how strong the brand is, and while it’s a down time now, it’s resilient,” David Carter, executive director of the Marshall Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern California, said when asked about the heavy load of ceremonies the Yankees now hold. But, he added, the events can also prompt a cynical sentiment like “Why do you continue to hit us over the head with how great you used to be?”Last year’s ceremonies in the Bronx showed that such days were crowd-pleasers on par with Old-Timers’ Day or playoff games. Indeed, one of the ceremonies in 2014 was conducted on Old-Timers’ Day, and the Yankees plan to use the same occasion for another this year.In 2014, the ceremonies honoring O’Neill, Gossage, Martinez and Torre produced crowds that averaged 47,407, a 13 percent jump over the full-season average at Yankee Stadium, according to Baseball-Reference.com.In addition, 48,110 fans attended a day of reverence for Jeter in his final season, but he will surely get another ceremony, perhaps this season or next, when he will have his number retired and a plaque presented. Jeter could even join the elite few honored in Monument Park with an actual monument, but even his elevated stature would probably not earn him anything close to the 7-foot-by-5-foot bronze homage to George Steinbrenner.",sports
"It all shows that Armstrong might have started out on a road to redemption two years ago, but that he took an early exit.Truth is still not part of his daily vocabulary. This month, Armstrong received two traffic tickets in Aspen, Colo., on charges that he hit two parked cars and left the scene of an accident. But that was only after his girlfriend, Anna Hansen, had gotten those tickets. She initially told the police that she was driving on the night of the hit-and-run because Armstrong had been drinking, but she later admitted that she had lied because she didn’t want his name in the news.So Armstrong’s great blueprint of winning back the public — tell the truth and reveal your goodness — wasn’t so great after all. After two years, has it faded so much that he can no longer make out the words? He continues to lie, and even had his girlfriend lie for him. And he is still fighting some of those people he tried to crush, like Hamman.Last month, Armstrong told the BBC that he would dope again if he were back in his early career and his competitors were doing it, too.That’s not the mark of a changed man. That’s the mark of a man who lacks self-perception. He remains so stubborn, so unwilling to admit failure, but no wonder. Those are two of the qualities that led him to be a champion.Now his competition is more daunting. He could lose more than $100 million in a federal whistle-blower case in which the United States Postal Service contends that Armstrong defrauded it when it was sponsoring Armstrong’s team and demanded in its contract that Armstrong not dope. Armstrong could have settled that case many times, but he has refused because he still thinks he can win it.The same way he thought he could beat SCA?Tillotson, SCA’s lawyer, said Armstrong had offered money to SCA several times to settle the case, but nowhere near the $14.5 million-plus that Hamman had dished out in the matter over the years. That’s why Hamman is not backing down.",sports
"Here’s a tip on choosing the perfect seats for this summer’s Little League World Series.Forget the ones next to the dugouts or along the baselines. Get the cheapest ones you can find — the ones at the tippy-top of the old stadium in South Williamsport, Pa., or in the hinterlands of the outfield’s grassy hill. The farther away from home plate, the better.The players would be just a blur. But that’s the point.This is why: Jackie Robinson West — the hard-hitting team from the South Side of Chicago that last year became the first all-black team to reach the tournament final — was stripped of its United States championship Wednesday for knowingly including ringers from outside its district on its roster.The revelation was proof that even at the youth level, baseball these days is best viewed from a distance.From far away, you can pretend that the game is just the way you remember playing it, and just the way Little League International touts it to be. It’s America’s game, watched best with a slice of apple pie. Drive your Chevrolet to the game, grab a hot dog, and settle in for six innings of sportsmanship.",sports
"The most believable part about Alex Rodriguez’s public apology to the Yankees and fans Tuesday for past misdeeds might have been the section in which he acknowledged that most people would not believe anything he said. The most unusual part might have been his chosen medium for the moment: a handwritten letter, in cursive, in 2015. Most offensive, stylistically, was probably his decision to stretch the letter to a second page, making it aesthetically unpleasing on social media.But faults aside, the apology did not measure up in the pantheon of bad sports apologies. History will judge, but the note’s handwritten nature alone will not make it all that memorable. In fact, in an extreme case of Marshall McLuhan’s adage “the medium is the message,” the look of the letter remained a topic of discussion when Rodriguez’s words were already starting to fade.For a bad sports apology to endure, it must contain a unique element. In a parade of bad apologies that often begin with “I’m sorry” and all too often end with “if you were offended,” the really memorable ones set themselves apart by digging the hole even deeper and, in some extreme cases, end up surpassing the original transgression.Making Things WorseImage Roberto Alomar's initial apology for spitting on the umpire John Hirschbeck actually inflamed the situation. Credit Moe Doiron/Associated PressThe high-water mark for a situation in which an apology made things worse came from the baseball Hall of Famer Roberto Alomar, who spat in the face of the umpire John Hirschbeck after being thrown out of a game in 1996 for arguing a third-strike call. The act was bad enough, but when asked to explain his actions, Alomar upped the ante considerably by blaming Hirschbeck’s grief over the death of his 8-year-old son three years before for the incident.",sports
"Later, John Thompson Jr., Georgetown’s renowned coach, never failed to speak, publicly or privately, about how much he admired Smith as a friend, as a mentor and as an ally in battling to give young black athletes opportunities.Two personal encounters with Smith, who died Saturday, showed me all I needed to know.The first came in 1993, when North Carolina’s campus was embroiled in a controversy over the construction of a free-standing black culture center.That year, in which the Tar Heels won the N.C.A.A. tournament, one of Smith’s players wanted to wear a patch on his uniform or his shoes as a sign of solidarity with the students demonstrating in favor of the culture center. I cannot remember whether the player, George Lynch, followed through and wore the patch; what I do remember is that Smith, out of respect for Lynch, told him that it was his decision — if Lynch felt that strongly about the issue, Smith would allow it.Smith’s defining moment for me, however, came in March 1995, during the N.C.A.A. tournament.North Carolina, along with Georgetown and Kentucky, was placed in the Southeast Region of the bracket, with games to be played in Birmingham, Ala. The arena was close to the 16th Street Baptist Church, where four young black girls had been killed when the church was bombed in 1963.Thompson, Georgetown’s coach, took his players to the church for a tour as soon as they arrived in Birmingham. Smith, after a North Carolina practice, asked me whether Thompson had taken his players there. Upon learning that he had, Smith said — mostly to himself — that he should have taken his players, too. We were struck by the symmetry: Three teams that in 1963 would not have even recruited black players were competing down the street from a symbol of racist intransigence.",sports

"The first momentous collapse occurred in the election of 1800, and nativism proved central to it. In order to suppress rising unruly democratic forces aligned with Thomas Jefferson, the dominant Federalist Party of John Adams and Alexander Hamilton stirred popular fears of a menacing enemy within, including immigrants friendly to the Jeffersonians.The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 went after unnaturalized immigrants as well as opposition newspaper editors; Hamilton, an immigrant himself, called for their wholesale deportation, remarking that “the mass ought to be obliged to leave the country.” The hysteria eventually rattled moderate Federalists, including President Adams, and opened deep divisions inside the party, paving the way for Jefferson’s victory. The broken Federalist Party survived for a decade and a half more, but would never again hold the presidency or a majority in either house of Congress.In the 1850s, abolitionist politicians proclaimed that American slavery had to be placed, as Abraham Lincoln declared, “in the course of ultimate extinction.” At the same time, mass immigration from Ireland and Germany was inflaming prejudice against Catholics.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyIn 1854 the Whigs, one of the two major parties, collapsed over slavery. But while some Whigs joined the antislavery cause, others switched to the nativist Know-Nothing or American Party, which for a time looked as if it would supplant the Whigs. Out of the chaos emerged a new antislavery party, the Republicans, which got Lincoln elected to the presidency in 1860. After the Union Army vanquished the slavocracy, the Republican Party went on to largely command national government and politics for nearly 70 years.Early in the 20th century, economic and social change produced major reforms to rein in what President Theodore Roosevelt called “malefactors of great wealth.” After World War I, though, the old guard in the Republican Party, announcing a return of American greatness, regained the initiative, buoyed in part by a resurgent nativism that brought about the law drastically restricting immigration in 1924.Yet when the crash of 1929 led to the Great Depression, conservatives had little to offer. The Republican supremacy collapsed in the election of 1932; the Democratic Party picked up the mantle of reform, and Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal shaped the contours of American government and politics for the next two generations. Between 1932 and 1968 only one Republican, Dwight Eisenhower, won the presidency, but even he acted to ratify a bipartisan New Deal consensus.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But Reagan and his party never consolidated a new political order, as Jefferson, Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt had done. To pursue such regressive old-guard policies as trickle-down economics, the Republican right provoked a culture war, instigating furious currents of resentment against social and cultural changes that were transforming American life: the expansion of an African-American middle class, profound changes in gender, sexual and family norms, and enormous immigration from Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia enabled by a new immigration law enacted in 1965.But the culture warriors failed to turn back the clock, and Reaganomics, intensified during the presidency of George W. Bush, fostered inequality and speculation. As that recklessness propelled the nation toward the financial crash of 2008, another political reckoning loomed.The reckoning began to unfold with the election of Barack Obama, weeks after the crash, which signaled the impending defeat of the Republican culture war. By momentarily corralling the rebellious Tea Party movement, the Republicans regained control of the House in 2010, thereafter blocking much of the Obama White House’s agenda. But the strategy of paralysis, heightened when Republicans won the Senate majority in 2014, could not overshadow Mr. Obama’s two major achievements in his first two years, the Affordable Care Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, when he worked with a Democratic Congress. Nor could the Republicans prevent Mr. Obama’s re-election in 2012.As the 2016 elections approached, old and new fissures began to crack open. The party’s base, including Tea Party insurgents and evangelicals, had become furious with a Republican leadership powerless to halt the growing diversification, racial inclusiveness and cultural openness of American life, which it associated with Mr. Obama. At the same time, the party establishment had nothing to offer hard-pressed, working-class Republican voters except discredited bromides about tax cuts, deregulation and plans to slash Medicare and privatize Social Security.In stepped Mr. Trump, who exploited the party’s internal weaknesses. He had already won favor with the base by joining with the “birthers” to attack Mr. Obama’s legitimacy as president. He opened his candidacy with a nativist outburst, assailing illegal immigration and calling Mexicans rapists and drug dealers, which fed the base’s economic and cultural discontent. But he also punctured the Republicans’ tattered economic orthodoxy, defending entitlements and blaming free trade for hollowing out the middle class.Should Mr. Trump and his followers consolidate their control over the Republican Party, they will have converted it into something that Reagan would hardly recognize. But no matter how the power struggle is finally decided, it is clear that the party of Reagan’s era, uniting free market, small government conservatism with white working-class cultural fears and resentments, has come unglued — and no Republican leader or faction seems capable of putting it back together.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMr. Trump’s railing against “political correctness” thrills his followers.

"Dr. Israelian is a rocker-scientist who had his own punk band and studied astrophysics in Armenia before emigrating to Spain with his family in the 1970s. He moved to Tenerife and began researching supernovas at the observatories — with Pink Floyd, Peter Gabriel, Brian Eno and other ’70s rockers blasting on his earphones.He welcomed attendees standing before a giant LED backdrop of a beam of light slicing through a triangle and splitting into a prism, homage to the cover of Pink Floyd’s “Dark Side of the Moon” album, and the sounds of the band’s “Breathe” reverberating through the floor. When the music died down, he talked about the telescopes a few hours uphill.Advertisement Continue reading the main story“The huge eye looking out into space seems to me to be an uplifting symbol of humanity’s eye looking out into the vast universe where we live in such a small corner,” Dr. Israelian said. “But our species is capable of looking beyond.”The islands are essential to extraterrestrial exploration now, but they played a key role in earthly exploration as well. Columbus stopped there in 1492, that banner year in the human enterprise of looking beyond. Drifting down the coast of Africa before steering west to discover the Americas, the explorer dropped anchor and fueled up on fresh water and fruit here.The islands were not exactly new to mainland Europeans when Columbus arrived. The origin of their name is the Latin word for dog — cane — possibly because, as the ancient Roman author and naturalist Pliny the Elder wrote, early Roman visitors to the islands encountered huge dogs. The small tropical birds we call canaries, native to these islands and others, are named after the islands — not the other way around.But when Columbus dropped anchor, the islands were still inhabited by a tall, white-skinned people called the Guanches. They lived in the mountain caves, wore goatskins and mummified their dead in the Egyptian fashion. Teide, capped with snow in the winter, and the island’s name, Tenerife, are both words that come from the indigenous people’s name for “white mountain.”PhotoOn the nearby island of La Gomera, schoolchildren are still taught an indigenous whistling language that those inhabitants of the island used to communicate over distances before the arrival of the telephone.But other than those few words and traditions, for the lost goatskin-wearing natives, Columbus’s arrival heralded the end of language, culture and time. Within two years of the explorer’s stopover, the Spaniards had colonized the islands and eradicated the Guanche, selling the survivors as white slaves on the Continent. What remains of them today are some of their names, like Teide, and words for some of the flowers that grow only along its rocky ridges.After Columbus, the great German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt landed here in the 18th century and explored the islands, identifying one of the four cold water currents in the world drifting past the islands, which partly accounts for the near-perfect weather. The sky is literally cloudless 90 percent of the year.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

Tenerife is filled with microclimates, green toward the north and barren to the south. In winter, it is possible to swim on the beaches and, an hour later, ascend the volcano and stand in three feet of snow.The islands’ bounty and idyllic — and strategic — location made them a colonial prize by the 18th century, and it was here that the Spaniards shot off Admiral Horatio Nelson’s right arm with a cannon while defending Tenerife against the British Navy in 1797. He survived and went home with a condolence prize of casks of sweet Canarian wine, for which the British developed a taste that has not abated to this day. George Washington supposedly toasted the revolution with a glass of it.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyFor modern-day American visitors, the Canary Islands resemble the Caribbean, but possess facilities and characteristics of Europe — hospitals, low crime, relatively high standard of living, Spanish culture and healthy, delicious food (great tapas, olive oil, indigenous white goat cheese and a local delicacy, “wrinkled potatoes” boiled in salted water until the water evaporates). But the chief difference between Tenerife and, say, Aruba or the Bahamas is the island’s role in international space endeavors.Dr. Israelian conceived Starmus, the island’s science and rock festival in 2011, and its name is short for “star music.” The concept of music from stars — unlike the medieval “music of the spheres” — actually has some basis in science and Dr. Israelian has made a study of it.“When the first sound waves were detected in stars, about 10 years ago, I realized this whole new branch of astronomy was starting,” he said. “We have tools to detect those sound waves. They are low frequency, infra-sounds, the timbre is different, but I can take the sound … and I can move it to our domain, so we can hear it. It’s playing the piano, 10 octaves down.”Dr. Israelian, who is compiling a library of the star sounds, likes to think big (he’s working on projects to help Armenian and other orphans in Syria).",politics
"To the Editor:Re “The Reactionary Mind” (column, April 24):The “neoreactionaries,” conservatives opposed to liberal orthodoxy whom Ross Douthat would like to see in academia, actually do exist in the academy: But we are called scientists. The reason that we tend to identify with the left is that the right has established a long record of supporting ideologically driven political policies that run counter to empirical evidence.In general, these policies have taken the form of reaction against change despite overwhelming evidence that such changes will serve the common good. Examples include resistance to controls on tobacco, pollution, seatbelts, civil rights, access to health care, evolution and climate change.Additionally, the general perception that resistance to such changes is based on narrow financial and/or ideological interests has served to further discredit the right.Our civilization is founded on science and technology, without which nowhere near 7.5 billion human beings could possibly be living on this planet.

"When the push for diversity ends at ideology: Is there a bias against hiring conservatives?To the Editor: Re “A Confession of Liberal Intolerance,” by Nicholas Kristof (column, May 8):Some of us in scientific fields of academia believe that it may be rational to disqualify a job candidate for being evangelical if this includes a literal interpretation of the Bible (such as that the Earth is only a few thousand years old). Also, economists might want to hear, from a possibly Republican job candidate, a realistic scenario for how future growth would compensate for tax cuts. Not all “bias” is irrational, when it is connected not with group membership per se, but with rejection of observation, logic and their products, such as Darwin’s theory of evolution. The university is a forum for developing and airing beliefs and knowledge that have a solid basis. For their forums, evangelicals have places of worship, and Republicans have Fox News.JOHN L. MICHELAWaterloo, OntarioThe writer is an associate professor of psychology at University of Waterloo.To the Editor: It is great to see an article that points out that the social science emperors don’t have any clothes on when it comes to tolerating and welcoming diverse perspectives on political and religious issues. But I disagree with Nicholas Kristof’s statement that universities should not offer affirmative action for conservatives and evangelicals. This is true in the sense that universities should not offer faculty positions to people who lack the necessary academic accomplishments. But universities could do a lot of things short of preferential treatment for conservatives and evangelicals — for example, vigorously seeking out qualified people with these views, and making it clear that they and their views will be welcomed.JAMES P.

"Trump’s successful deployment of the issue of immigration to mobilize voters raises this question: Why is his opposition to immigrants and Mexicans in particular so resonant when immigration liberalization ostensibly has majority support in most polls?Research conducted by Lefteris Jason Anastasopoulos, a lecturer and data science fellow at Berkeley’s School of Information, provides one answer: Support for immigration “may be greatly overestimated.”In an email, Anastasopoulos writes thatpolls conducted by large survey organizations never ask about immigration in geographic context. Instead they ask questions about whether respondents support increasing immigration or granting amnesty for undocumented immigrants in the “United States” overall rather than, say, Dayton, Ohio, or Wilmington, North Carolina, places where immigration has been rapidly increasing over the past few years. This kind of abstract framing tends to push respondents toward giving more “politically correct” answers to standard poll questions about immigration.The result isa significant underestimation of the backlash against newly arriving immigrants and an overestimation of the support for immigration among the public.The refusal of Democrats and the American left to hear — or to grant some legitimacy to — the grievances of white America as it loses power and stature to ascendant minorities and to waves of immigrants from across the globe undergirds the Trump movement. In the zero sum world of immigration politics, it has proved impossible so far to convincingly affirm the validity of the claims of both sides.The quest by American liberals and progressives for support, or at least tolerance, of diversity, inclusiveness and multiculturalism is likely to prevail — particularly if the compulsory dimension of compliance is curtailed.Jonathan Haidt, a professor at N.Y.U., suggested to me that one way to better understand the intensity of Trump’s appeal is by looking at something called “psychological reactance.” Haidt describes reactance asthe feeling you get when people try to stop you from doing something you’ve been doing, and you perceive that they have no right or justification for stopping you. So you redouble your efforts and do it even more, just to show that you don’t accept their domination. Men in particular are concerned to show that they do not accept domination.The theory, first developed in 1966 by Jack W. Brehm in “A Theory of Psychological Reactance,” is directly relevant to the 2016 election, according to Haidt. Here is Brehm’s original language:Psychological reactance is an aversive affective reaction in response to regulations or impositions that impinge on freedom and autonomy. This reaction is especially common when individuals feel obliged to adopt a particular opinion or engage in a specific behavior. Specifically, a perceived diminution in freedom ignites an emotional state, called psychological reactance, that elicits behaviors intended to restore this autonomy.Haidt applies this to the 2016 election:Translated to the Trump phenomenon, I would say that decades of political correctness, with its focus on “straight white men” as the villains and oppressors — now extended to “straight white cis-gendered men” — has caused some degree of reactance in many and perhaps most white men.In both the workplace and academia, Haidt argues,the accusatory and vindictive approach of many social justice activists and diversity trainers may actually have increased the desire and willingness of some white men to say and do un-PC things.In this atmosphere, according to Haidt,Trump comes along and punches political correctness in the face. Anyone feeling some degree of anti-PC reactance is going to feel a thrill in their heart, and will want to stand up and applaud. And because feelings drive reasoning, these feelings of gratitude will make it hard for anyone to present arguments to them about the downsides of a Trump presidency.Trump’s anger at being policed or fenced in apparently speaks to the resentment of many American men and their resistance to being instructed, particularly by a female candidate, on how they should think, speak or behave.On April 26, Trump wheeled out a spectacularly offensive attack on Clinton, perhaps designed to provoke the response it got. He accused her of playing “the women’s card” when “she has got nothing else going. Frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she would get 5 percent of the vote.”Hillary rose to the bait. Three days later, appearing on Jake Tapper’s CNN show “The Lead,” she countered:I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak. … I am not going to deal with their temper tantrums, or their bullying or their efforts to try to provoke me. He can say whatever he wants to say about me, I could really care less.Trump responded on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show on May 2. What Clinton said “was a very derogatory statement to men,” Trump declared. “It was almost as though she’s going to tell us what to do, tell men what to do.” He continued, “It was a real put-down.”",politics
"IT is easy to laugh at the proverbial “black friend” invoked to neutralize charges of racism. However, the humor sours when you realize that this comical ploy is also a strategy the Republican Party uses in its outreach to black and moderate white voters.Despite the whiteness of the G.O.P. in general — about 90 percent of voters in the Republican primaries this year have been white — a number of black Republicans hold prominent positions in the party, and are often held up as evidence of its commitment to diversity. Last year, for example, when the presidential candidate Ben Carson was doing well in the polls, his presence on the campaign trail helped prompt the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, to claim that the G.O.P. was “likely to have the most diverse presidential primary field in history — of either party.”Promoting black Republicans in this fashion may or may not succeed in convincing white voters that the party is not as racially divisive as it can seem. But less appreciated is the effect that this approach has on black voters. As recent research of mine suggests, the image of black Republicans that the G.O.P. disseminates may actually dampen enthusiasm for the party — not only among the black electorate in general, but also among black Republicans themselves.A common thread that links high-profile black Republicans like Mr. Carson is their commitment to “colorblind” politics. You can also see this with recently elected politicians like Representative Mia Love of Utah and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina. They acknowledge that being black is part of their life experience but reject the idea that racial identity should orient their political decision making. They often decry efforts, like affirmative action, to address racial inequality explicitly, claiming that such policies undermine black success.",politics
"Revenge politics and paranoia are distracting the government of Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli from Nepal’s urgent problems a year after an earthquake killed nearly 9,000 people. Nepal’s government has been struggling to find firm footing since the end of a decade-long insurgency in 2006 and the tumultuous process of adopting a new Constitution last September.On May 3, the government moved to revoke the valid work visa of a Canadian citizen, Robert Penner, and to request that he “voluntarily” leave the country after it received anonymous complaints that his Twitter posts were “spreading unnecessary messages about Nepal.” Mr. Penner had tweeted about a Human Rights Watch report on deaths and injuries last fall during protests against the newConstitution by Madhesi and other ethnic groups.The groups felt boundaries in a new federal system disenfranchised them. During the protests at Nepal’s southern border, trade from India was halted, causing hardship for many Nepalese and straining relations between the countries. On Friday, Nepal canceled a scheduled visit to India by President Bidhya Devi Bhandari.Mr. Penner had also been critical of the arrest on April 22 of a prominent journalist and activist, Kanak Mani Dixit. Nepal’s Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority ordered the arrest during an investigation into alleged misappropriation of funds by Mr. Dixit, who is also chairman of a public transportation company. Lokman Singh Karki, a longtime nemesis of Mr. Dixit’s, is head of the commission. Mr. Dixit has fully cooperated with the investigation. His arrest prompted an international outcry, and Nepal’s Supreme Court rightly ordered his release on May 2.",politics
"Why is this important? Because an online survey, whatever other flaws it might have, resembles an anonymous voting booth far more than what you tell a pollster does.In a May 2015 report, Pew Research analyzed the differences between results derived from telephone polling and those from online Internet polling. Pew determined that the biggest differences in answers elicited via these two survey modes were on questions in which social desirability bias — that is, “the desire of respondents to avoid embarrassment and project a favorable image to others” — played a role.In a detailed analysis of phone versus online polling in Republican primaries, Kyle A. Dropp, the executive director of polling and data science at Morning Consult, writes:Trump’s advantage in online polls compared with live telephone polling is eight or nine percentage points among likely voters.This difference, Dropp notes, is driven largely by more educated voters — those who would be most concerned with “social desirability.”These findings suggest that Trump will head into the general election with support from voters who are reluctant to admit their preferences to a live person in a phone survey, but who may well be inclined to cast a ballot for Trump on Election Day.Conflicting online and phone poll findings in response to Trump’s call on Dec. 7, 2015 — five days after two terrorists killed 14 people in San Bernardino, Calif. — for a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on” demonstrate the difficulty gauging Trump’s strength.Phone-based surveys in December by the Washington Post/ABC News, CBS News and NBC/Wall Street Journal found strong majorities — 57 to 60 percent — of Americans opposed to the proposal.At the same time, YouGov, operating online, found substantial and growing support for Trump’s proposal, with a plurality, 45-41, in support. When YouGov repeated the question on March 24-25 — just after the terrorist attacks in Brussels — support had grown to 51-40.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThis December-to-March shift was strongest among independent voters, who increased their support from 42-37 in favor of the ban to 62-37 in favor. Similarly, a March 29 Morning Consult online poll found majority support for the ban, 50-38, with voters who identified themselves as independents favoring Trump’s plan 49-36.I asked a number of experts about the disparity between online and phone polls. All of them — Alan Abramowitz, John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck, political scientists who specialize in the analysis of poll data — agreed that in the case of highly contentious issues, respondents can be more willing to express their real views anonymously, to a computer rather than to a human.Kathy Frankovic, the former CBS polling director who now works for YouGov, told me that “it’s easier to express potentially ‘unacceptable’ responses on a screen than it is to give them to a person.” Douglas Rivers, a political scientist at Stanford and the chief scientist for YouGov, agreed, noting in an email that stronger support in online polls for a ban on Muslimsmay be due to social desirability bias — people are more willing to express support for this privately than when asked by someone else.Needless to say, Trump has expressed confrontational views on a number of fronts. He claims that as president he will impose harsh tariffs on imports from China, suspend Muslim immigration, deport 11 million immigrants and build an $8 billion wall that Mexico will pay for.Taken together, these positions have provided a foundation for the strong correlation between support for Trump and white ethnocentrism and white racial resentment.One method of ranking whites on ethnocentrism is to measure the degree to which they believe Caucasians are more trustworthy, intelligent, industrious and less violent than African-Americans, Hispanics and other minorities. These are the kinds of questions that prompt certain respondents in phone surveys to mask their views and provide socially acceptable answers instead.The accompanying chart, which uses data provided to The Times by Marc Hetherington and Drew Engelhardt, political scientists at Vanderbilt, shows that white Republicans are the most ethnocentric of all voters, but also that there are substantial numbers of ethnocentric white Democrats and white independents.How a Changing World Looks to White America A 2016 survey rated whites by ethnocentrism, the belief that whites are superior to others. Here is how white respondents evaluated these groups — blacks; Hispanics; Muslims; gays and lesbians; and transgender people — as a whole, relative to whites. The survey sorted respondents by political affiliation. Favorable Neutral Unfavorable 41 Dem. 38% 20 59 Ind. 16% 25 73 Repub. 11% 16 All white respondents 23 20 57 Favorable Neutral Unfavorable 41 Democrats 38% 20 59 Independents 16% 25 73 Republicans 11% 16 All white respondents 23% 20 57This suggests that Trump could potentially find significant levels of support not only among Republican voters, but also among white Democrats and independents.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyNow that Trump appears to have the Republican nomination in hand, the question becomes: Can he capitalize on racial resentment among Democrats and independents in the general election?Perhaps not surprisingly, Hetherington and Engelhardt found that racial resentment follows a similar pattern to the expression of white ethnocentrism. It is highest among Republicans, but it is also present among Democrats and independents. The second chart derived from their data shows that in rankings of racial resentment, more than half of white Republicans, 58 percent, fall into the top four most resentful categories.White Against Black Whites were surveyed and placed on a 17-point scale that gauges the racial resentment they feel toward African-Americans. Here is the percentage of Democrats, independents and Republicans who fell into the least resentful (having a positive view of blacks) and most resentful ends of the scale. Democrats 10% 5 LEVEL OF RESENTMENT: Most Least 22% 23% of Democrats 15% Independents 10 5 Most Least 42% 10% 24% of white Republicans were at the extreme end of the resentment scale. 20% Republicans 15 10 5 Most Least 58% 0.4% 24% of white Republicans were at the extreme end of the resentment scale. 20% Democrats Independents Republicans 15 10 5 LEVEL OF RESENTMENT: Most Most Most Least Least Least 22 42 58 23% 10% 0.4% of DemocratsWhat should prove worrisome for Democrats is that 42 percent of white independents also fall into the four most resentful categories, as do 22 percent of white Democrats.Even polls using traditional phone survey methods find notable support for issues high on Trump’s agenda. You can see this, for example, in attitudes toward the Chinese, Muslims and Mexicans — all of whom Trump has demonized.Anger toward China appears to offer fertile ground for Trump in the general election. In its 2015 American Values Survey, the Public Religion Research Institute asked how responsible China is for American “economic problems.” Solid majorities of Democrats (70 percent), independents (72 percent) and Republicans (80 percent) said China is “very” or “somewhat” responsible.Or take another Trump theme: Islam. The P.R.R.I. values survey asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement “the values of Islam are at odds with American values and way of life.” Among all voters, 56 percent said that they agreed. Republican were strongest at 76 percent, but independents came in at 57 percent, with Democrats trailing at a still robust 43 percent.The Polling Report, an aggregation of public opinion surveys, presents data on immigration from multiple sources. On a basic question — what should happen to the 11 million undocumented men, women and children now living within the borders of the United States — most traditional surveys show strong support for finding ways to legalize the status of those who have not committed crimes and have paid taxes.A March 2016 Pew study found, for example, that voters preferred allowing undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States over attempting to deport them by 74-25. It also found that a majority said immigrants strengthen the country (as opposed to adding a burden), 57-35. These are not good numbers for Trump.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyBut poll results (irrespective of whether questions are posed online or by phone) can change quite a bit depending on their exact wording, the specific issues addressed and even the placement of a query in a series of questions.For example, a September 2015 Pew survey asked a related but different set of questions about immigrants that produced results more favorable to Trump’s prospects. Voters reported (50-28) that they believe that immigrants damage the economy (as opposed to making it better), with a fifth saying that immigrants don’t have much effect. Voters also reported that they think that immigrants make crime worse rather than better (50-7), with 41 percent saying that they don’t have much effect.There are a few conclusions to be drawn.First, the way Trump has positioned himself outside of the traditional boundaries of politics will make it unusually difficult to gauge public support for him and for many of his positions.Second, the allegiance of many white Democrats and independents is difficult to predict — cross-pressured as they are by the conflict between unsavory Trump positions they are drawn to and conscience or compunction. The ambivalence of many Republicans toward Trump as their party’s brazenly defiant nominee will further compound the volatility of the electorate.Finally, the simple fact that Trump has beaten the odds so far means that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that he could beat them again. If he does take the White House, much, if not all, of his margin of victory will come from voters too ashamed to acknowledge publicly how they intend to cast their vote.",politics

"But there is another way of thinking about the gaffe: as an inevitable expression of the paradoxes of scrupulously objective political reporting, pressures that have held reporters hostage for decades. Until Trump, of all people, set us free.The journalistic ritual of gaffe-spotting dates approximately to the Vietnam era, but it blossomed into a full-blown obsession during the 1980 candidacy of Ronald Reagan, whose malapropisms were well noted even before he won the Republican nomination. Before the summer was out, reporters were fulminating over his description of the Vietnam War as a “noble cause” and his suggestion that the United States should pursue official relations with Taiwan — a move that contradicted the terms of normalization previously negotiated between the United States and China. Both statements were within the spectrum of conservative opinion, but reporters took them as blunders. By early September, press reports routinely described Reagan’s campaign, in The Times’s words, as on “the political defensive after a string of admittedly costly verbal gaffes.”Two months later, Reagan trounced Carter, winning 44 states. During his administration, verbal pratfalls became enough of a running joke that David Gergen, then his director of communications, commissioned a large plaster foot with a bullet hole in it to be passed around. The Washington Post’s Lou Cannon diligently cataloged the “Reaganism of the Week”; Dinesh D’Souza, who worked in the White House during Reagan’s second term, wrote later that “Reagan had no objection and frequently turned to the column to discover his own gaffes. Reagan’s advisers soon discovered what the boss already knew: that Americans didn’t mind his gaffes and were even entertained by them.”What Reagan understood, in D’Souza’s telling, was that a gaffe revealed at least as much about the journalists who called attention to it as it did about the politician who uttered it. It reflected their own preoccupations and biases, which voters did not necessarily share. Ever since the late 1960s, when reporters began to take a more active role in scrutinizing presidential candidates, they had operated on the assumption that the way a candidate managed the challenges and humiliations of the campaign trail was in some way reflective of how they would perform in the White House itself — that a candidacy was a meaningful simulation of a presidency. By the 1980s, this vision of campaign reporting was toppling into solipsism. Journalists were, effectively, grading politicians on their ability to perform what everyone understood to be a largely artificial version of themselves — practicing a kind of theater criticism as much as political reporting.This reached its magnificent zenith in 2012, when a Washington Post reporter shouted at Mitt Romney during a photo op in Warsaw, “What about your gaffes?” What about his gaffes? The George Washington University political scientist John Sides reviewed public-opinion data from the 2012 race and found that none of the hyperventilated-upon slips of the campaign — not even the surreptitiously filmed video of Romney’s “47 percent” comments — had any appreciable effect on either candidate’s support. In imagined service of the interests of voters, reporters had lost track of what actually mattered to them.",politics
"As he seeks to revive his embattled candidacy, Donald J. Trump has seized on a new argument to rally his supporters and to explain away a possible defeat in November: that Democrats are preparing to exploit weak voter identification laws to win a “stolen election” through fraudulent voting.The claim has spurred outrage among Democrats and has alarmed some Republicans who worry his tactics will backfire, angering minority voters and threatening the party’s chances in close races down the ballot.Since 2010, Republican governors and Republican-held state legislatures have fought for stricter voter identification laws, which Democrats argue are intended to hinder turnout by the poorest voters, many of them black and Hispanic, who tend to vote Democratic.But Mr. Trump’s language has moved beyond his party’s call for rigid identification requirements and the unfounded claims that polls are “skewed” to predictions of outright theft of the November election. And his warnings have been cast in increasingly urgent and racially suggestive language, hinting that the only legitimate outcome in certain states would be his victory.",politics
"Americans have grown accustomed to observing female leaders elsewhere, including Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May in Britain, and Angela Merkel in Germany. At home, the Democratic pollster Peter Hart said, the rise of some women to the top of major corporations smoothed a path for voters to envision a woman in the Oval Office.“There is much greater acceptance of women being able to be seen in that commander-in-chief role,” Mr. Hart said. He advised the 1984 presidential campaign of Walter Mondale, who picked Mrs. Ferraro as his running mate.Mrs. Ferraro, then in her sixth year in the House of Representatives, didn’t shrink from the “let me help you” barb in her debate. “I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you have to teach me about foreign policy,” she shot back.Mrs. Clinton need not fear that line of argument. In the poll Mr. Hart helps conduct for NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, voters last month preferred her over Mr. Trump by 26 percentage points on conducting foreign policy, 18 points on handling a crisis, and 11 points on serving as commander in chief.Nor does Mrs. Clinton, whose truthfulness was called into question most recently over her use of a private email server while she was secretary of state, benefit from any presumption of honesty. Just 22 percent of voters in the NBC-Wall Street Journal poll rated her highly as “honest and straightforward,” the sort of finding that Mr. Trump has worked to exploit by frequently referring to her as “Crooked Hillary.”Mr. Trump has also sought to attack Mrs. Clinton by suggesting that the success of her campaign is rooted almost entirely in her gender.“If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she’d get 5 percent of the vote,” he said last spring. “The only thing she’s got going is the women’s card.”",politics
"“It’s not just about the kids putting down the guns,” the group’s founder, Tamar Manasseh, said to The Huffington Post. “It’s about the kids never picking them up to begin with.”But such attention doesn’t last long, which contributes to the false impression that such actions are rare. The reality is that these organizations are just the visible edges of an enormous anti-crime activist network in black communities.Another reason they draw so little attention is that communities that protest violence generally don’t have the economic and political resources necessary to engage with elite news media or hire lobbyists in state capitals or Washington. They typically have access only to the mayor’s staff, city council members, district attorneys and other city officials.But prosecutors and police groups do have such resources. I found that criminal justice agencies represent a large plurality of witnesses at state and national hearings on crime issues. The voices of people living in high-crime communities, however, were largely absent. The result is policies that prioritize the needs of police and prosecutors.This skewed representation makes it harder for us to see the common interests of anti-violence groups. They share at least one main political message: Efforts to keep young people away from violence would be made more effective by addressing shoddy schools, the lack of good jobs, the easy access to guns and the neglect of urban communities. State and national politicians and groups — not local organizers — simplify this complex advocacy on crime and criminal justice into pro- or anti-police narratives.In fact, anti-violence activists understand best that the crime problem is much more than a policing problem. Though police in many communities have made great strides in preventive work, their priorities are primarily reactive. This work is crucial, but it’s not the same as long-term crime prevention. Nonetheless, over the past 40 years, state governments and Congress have funneled huge sums of money to law enforcement, while underinvesting in education, employment and empowerment, all of which is needed for serious crime prevention.Black activists know that all Americans — not just middle-class or wealthy whites — deserve protection by the police, as well as from the police. There is nothing contradictory about worrying that friends or family members might be killed by someone in the neighborhood, and also being concerned that they might get killed by the police.Grass-roots organizations in black communities lead the efforts to make their streets safe. We need to get rid of the offensive falsehood that black people don’t care about crime, and help create the reforms they’ve long demanded.",politics
"The combination of populist movements with social media is often held responsible for post-truth politics. Individuals have growing opportunities to shape their media consumption around their own opinions and prejudices, and populist leaders are ready to encourage them.But to focus on recent, more egregious abuses of facts is to overlook the ways in which the authority of facts has been in decline for quite some time. Newspapers might provide resistance to the excesses of populist demagogy, but not to the broader crisis of facts.The problem is the oversupply of facts in the 21st century: There are too many sources, too many methods, with varying levels of credibility, depending on who funded a given study and how the eye-catching number was selected.According to the cultural historian Mary Poovey, the tendency to represent society in terms of facts first arose in late medieval times with the birth of accounting. What was new about merchant bookkeeping, Dr. Poovey argued, was that it presented a type of truth that could apparently stand alone, without requiring any interpretation or faith on the part of the person reading it.In the centuries that followed, accounting was joined by statistics, economics, surveys and a range of other numerical methods. But even as these methods expanded, they tended to be the preserve of small, tight-knit institutions, academic societies and professional associations who could uphold standards. National statistical associations, for example, soon provided the know-how for official statistics offices, affiliated with and funded by governments.In the 20th century, an industry for facts emerged. Market-research companies began to conduct surveys in the 1920s and extended into opinion polling in the 1930s. Think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute were established during and after World War II to apply statistics and economics to the design of new government policies, typically in the service of one political agenda or another. The idea of “evidence-based policy,” popular among liberal politicians in the late 1990s and early 2000s, saw economics being heavily leaned on to justify government programs, in an allegedly post-ideological age.Of course the term “fact” isn’t reserved exclusively for numbers. But it does imply a type of knowledge that can be reliably parceled out in public, without constant need for verification or interpretation.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyYet there is one much more radical contributor to our post-truth politics that could ultimately be as transformative of our society as accounting proved to be 500 years ago.We are in the middle of a transition from a society of facts to a society of data. During this interim, confusion abounds surrounding the exact status of knowledge and numbers in public life, exacerbating the sense that truth itself is being abandoned.The place to start in understanding this transition is with the spread of “smart” technologies into everyday life, sometimes called the “internet of things.” Thanks to the presence of smartphones and smartcards in our pockets, the dramatic uptake of social media, the rise of e-commerce as a means of purchasing goods and services, and the spread of sensory devices across public spaces, we leave a vast quantity of data in our wake as we go about our daily activities.Like statistics or other traditional facts, this data is quantitative in nature. What’s new is both its unprecedented volume (the “big” in big data) and also the fact that it is being constantly collected by default, rather than by deliberate expert design. Numbers are being generated much faster than we have any specific use for. But they can nevertheless be mined to get a sense of how people are behaving and what they are thinking.The promise of facts is to settle arguments between warring perspectives and simplify the issues at stake. For instance, politicians might disagree over the right economic policy, but if they can agree that “the economy has grown by 2 percent” and “unemployment is 5 percent,” then there is at least a shared stable reality that they can argue over.The promise of data, by contrast, is to sense shifts in public sentiment. By analyzing Twitter using algorithms, for example, it is possible to get virtually real-time updates on how a given politician is perceived. This is what’s known as “sentiment analysis.”There are precedents for this, such as the “worm” that monitors live audience reaction during a televised presidential debate, rising and falling in response to each moment of a candidate’s rhetoric. Financial markets represent the sentiments of traders as they fluctuate throughout the day. Stock markets never produce a fact as to what Cisco is worth in the way that an accountant can; they provide a window into how thousands of people around the world are feeling about Cisco, from one minute to the next.Journalists and politicians can no more ignore a constant audit of collective mood than C.E.O.s can ignore the fluctuations in their companies’ share prices. If the British government had spent more time trying to track public sentiment toward the European Union and less time repeating the facts of how the British economy benefited from membership in the union, it might have fought the Brexit referendum campaign differently and more successfully.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyDominic Cummings, one of the leading pro-Brexit campaigners, mocked what he called outdated polling techniques. He also asked one pollster to add a question on “enthusiasm,” and, employing scientists to mine very large, up-to-the-minute data sets, to gauge voter mood and to react accordingly with ads and voter-turnout volunteers.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

Think of how we employ weather forecasts: We understand that it is not a fact that it will be 75 degrees on Thursday, and that figure will fluctuate all the time. Weather forecasting works in a similar way to sentiment analysis, bringing data from a wide range of sensory devices, and converting this into a constantly evolving narrative about the near future.However, this produces some chilling possibilities for politics. Once numbers are viewed more as indicators of current sentiment, rather than as statements about reality, how are we to achieve any consensus on the nature of social, economic and environmental problems, never mind agree on the solutions?Conspiracy theories prosper under such conditions. And while we will have far greater means of knowing how many people believe those theories, we will have far fewer means of persuading them to abandon them.",politics
"To the Editor:Re “Identity Politics and a Dad’s Loss” (column, Dec. 8):Nicholas Kristof argues that identity politics is necessary since “it’s not possible to have a serious conversation about justice, jobs and opportunity in America without talking frankly about race, gender and ethnicity.”What is missing here — and in the Democratic Party — is an appreciation of how profoundly the current form of identity politics prevents such a discussion.I am struck by how much this politics has changed in the last half-century. In the 1960s we were admonished to look past skin color or ethnicity so that we could see a person’s true identity, and we took that to heart. Now, people identify themselves and others according to the racial, ethnic or gender group into which they were born. This used to be considered the very foundation of racism.What has happened to our ability to treat one another as individual human beings rather than as stereotypes of one interest group or another?",politics
"At first, “The Crown” seems like perfect postelection escapism.In this Netflix drama about the rise and early reign of Queen Elizabeth II (Claire Foy), the stakes are incredibly low: An entire plot arc revolves around whether the queen’s husband, Philip, played with excellent brattiness by Matt Smith, will be permitted to take flying lessons. And as the president-elect spends his days lashing out on Twitter, it’s a relief to retreat into the stuffy drawing rooms of Buckingham Palace, where being well mannered is part of everyone’s job description.The show keeps its touch light by having political issues and the running of government take back seats to personality. It charts both the early career of Elizabeth, who took the throne in 1952 at the age of 25, and the late career of Winston Churchill, who stepped down as prime minister in 1955 at the age of 80. John Lithgow’s Churchill is fragile but wily, manipulating queen and country to hold onto power even as his health fails him. His deputy, Anthony Eden (Jeremy Northam), wants to depose him, but Eden has health troubles, too — one particularly heated argument between the two men ends with the deputy brandishing a “clean bill of health,” something I, at least, had never seen in physical form.As debate rages over which statesman is more sickly, the viewer could be forgiven for thinking the most important issue facing Britain in the 1950s was the cardiovascular fitness of its leaders. A brief mention of inflation is one of the few hints that Churchill had policies, as well as ailments. The Labour Party, which opposed Churchill’s Conservatives, is visible only briefly, notably during an abortive scheme to make the prime minister look bad when a toxic fog envelops the city.But perhaps the best example of the show’s odd treatment of politics comes during Elizabeth’s 1952 trip to Kenya, during which she learns that her father has died and she has become queen. Before that, Elizabeth and Philip greet a receiving line of Kenyan dignitaries, including a man wearing an elaborate headpiece.",politics
"Speaking in Boston, Senator Bernie Sanders partly endorsed Lilla’s principle: “One of the struggles that you’re going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics. I think it’s a step forward in America if you have an African-American C.E.O. of some major corporation. But you know what, if that guy is going to be shipping jobs out of this country, and exploiting his workers, it doesn’t mean a whole hell of a lot whether he’s black or white or Latino.”Lilla and Sanders have a legitimate point, and it’s clear in retrospect that the Democrats should have talked more about jobs and fairness for all. But Lilla and Sanders’s argument also collides with the basic truth that it’s not possible to have a serious conversation about justice, jobs and opportunity in America without talking frankly about race, gender and ethnicity.Consider the Crutcher family: Each of the children’s deaths wasn’t exactly about race, yet each was linked to it. Young black men are disproportionately likely to be stopped by police officers, and shot dead by them. Crib death and cancer both are more lethal among African-Americans, because of disparities in incomes and health care. And crime in America disproportionately involves blacks, as both victims and arrested perpetrators.So, sure, Democrats sometimes go overboard with identity and can do a far better job appealing to ALL who have been left behind — but identity still matters profoundly. The Crutchers have lost four young people, each in a way that statistically suggests a racial element.How can we discuss a way forward without acknowledging that race is an issue here?The blunt truth is that America’s most egregious failures have often involved identity, from slavery to anti-Catholic riots, from the Chinese Exclusion Act to the internment of Japanese-Americans, from unequal pay to acquiescence in domestic violence and sex trafficking.

Truman.A Long Island native, he was elected to Congress as a Democrat in the fall of 1958, only a year after arriving in West Virginia to teach government at Marshall College in Huntington.“I was a carpetbagger in a state where people and their ancestors are very much honored,” he said in an interview for the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum in 1985. “Everybody kept asking me, ‘Who are you kin to? Hechler? I never heard that name around here.’ ”",politics
"To the Editor:In “Donald Trump’s Racial Ignorance” (Sunday Review, Dec. 18), Michael Eric Dyson notes, “It seems more than a little reactionary to blame the loss of the election on a brand of identity politics that even liberals were slow to embrace.”I disagree. The McGovern-Fraser Commission reforms after the 1968 Democratic Convention — which have been in effect and expanded upon over the years — established identity politics as the main driving force behind all Democratic national campaigns since then.The Democrats lost the presidency in November because it seemed to many Americans that Democrats were more interested in where some people go to the bathroom than in attending to the economic needs of people who have been written off and left behind.Mr. Dyson is, however, quite correct about Donald Trump. He and the people he has appointed are woefully ignorant of the issue of racial equality. They have no real interest whatsoever in addressing the concerns of African-Americans and continue to support measures that disenfranchise people of color in most of the South and states like Wisconsin and Texas.",politics
"IF you have not yet heard the term “alt-right,” you most likely are living in another orbit. It is the chosen name of an extremist fringe with white supremacy at its roots. It is also a label many consider dangerous because it sanitizes the movement’s racist core. And if the media uses the word, they think, then they’re part of the problem.As the fire rages, The New York Times has become ground zero. Every time it uses the term — which it does frequently, given the alt-right’s ties to Donald Trump — letters pour in, social media ignites and the comments section overflows.Reporters and editors have huddled in sometimes tense discussions about when the term should be applied — or even whether. But so far, there is no move among top editors to ban it. Instead, their thinking is: You can use the phrase in a story, but make sure you include a blunt explanation of its meaning.To say this will be unsatisfying to many Times readers is probably a reckless understatement. I’ve received reams of emails and tweets from people complaining that The Times’s use of “alt-right” in its pages brings legitimacy to Trump’s inner circle. It “normalizes” his incoming administration, they claim, by sugarcoating the racist views of certain advisers.",politics
"I see that Tim Duy is angry at me again. The occasion is rather odd: I produced a little paper on trade and jobs, which I explicitly labeled “wonkish”; the point of the paper was, as I said, to reconcile what seemed to be conflicting assessments of the impacts of trade on overall manufacturing employment.But Duy is mad, because “dry statistics on trade aren’t working to counter Trump.” Um, that wasn’t the point of the exercise. This wasn’t a political manifesto, and never claimed to be. Nor was it a defense of conventional views on trade. It was about what the data say about a particular question. Are we not allowed to do such things in the age of Trump?Actually, maybe not. Part of the whole Trump phenomenon involves white working class voters rallying around a candidate who promised to bring back the coal and industrial jobs of the past, and lashing out at anyone who refuses to make similar promises. Yet the promise was and is fraudulent. If trying to get the analysis right is elitist, we’re in very big trouble — and perhaps we are.So what would a political manifesto aimed at winning over these voters look like? You could promise to make their lives better in ways that don’t involve bringing back the old plants and mines — which, you know, Obama did with health reform and Hillary would have done with family policies and more. But that apparently isn’t an acceptable answer.Can we promise new, different jobs? Job creation under Obama has been pretty good, but it hasn’t offered blue-collar jobs in the same places where the old industrial jobs have eroded.So maybe the answer is regional policies, to promote employment in declining regions? There is certainly a case in principle for doing this, since the costs of uprooting workers and families are larger than economists like to imagine. I would say, however, that the track record of regional support policies in other countries, which spend far more on such things than we are likely to, is pretty poor. For example, massive aid to the former East Germany hasn’t prevented a large decline in population, much bigger than the population decline in Appalachia over the same period.And I have to admit to a strong suspicion that proposals for regional policies that aim to induce service industries to relocate to the Rust Belt would not be well received, would in fact be attacked as elitist. People want those manufacturing jobs back, not something different. And it’s snooty and disrespectful to say that this can’t be done, even though it’s the truth.So I really don’t know the answer. But back to the starting point: when I analyze the effects of trade on manufacturing employment, the goal is to understand the effects of trade on manufacturing employment — not to win over voters. No, dry statistics aren’t good for political campaigns; but that’s no reason to ban statistics.",politics
"The house’s slowness gives Oz leisure to let sentences unfold. Characters and their ideas occupy the narrative foreground, while in the background a “charcoal-black cat, no doubt a tom, sometimes crossed the yard, slowly, imperiously, his tail erect, padding and gliding on velvety feet, as if each of his delicate paws did not step on the ground but languorously licked the polished paving stones that shone and glittered in the rain.” The book’s prose is meticulous, almost pre-modern. This and the plot’s stillness — days pile up, but many of the novel’s “events” are Shmuel’s realizations — make reading “Judas” feel a bit like reading Thomas Bernhard without the misanthropy.Instead of building an escalating triangle of plot, “Judas” lets the reader gradually understand things, most important the past that binds Wald and Atalia. For much of the book, their relationship is a mystery; when Shmuel mistakenly assumes Atalia is Wald’s wife, Wald responds: “Atalia is, in fact, my mistress. . . . I am not using the word in the vulgar sense, of course, but rather as in the famous saying of the first Queen Elizabeth of England: ‘I will have here but one mistress and no master.’ ” The thread that ties them together is dark and disturbing — I lost sleep over its imagery — and woven into the fabric of Israel’s bloody history.Learning Wald and Atalia’s story leads Shmuel to investigate Atalia’s father’s role in founding the state. Alone among the founders, and influenced by “the Arab revolt in 1936, Hitler, the underground movements, the killings, the retaliation operations of the Jewish underground, the hangings by the British and especially his conversations with his Arab friends,” Shealtiel came to believe “there was in fact room for the two communities and that it would be better for them to exist side by side, or one within the other, without the framework of a state.” By the standards of the novel’s time and ours, this is a radical view. Shealtiel Abravanel’s commitment to this idea means being expelled from the Zionist Executive Committee. “People abused and reviled him,” Wald says; “they called him a traitor.”This connection, made late in the book, sheds light on a thread that has run more or less without explanation through the novel: Shmuel’s abandoned thesis on Jewish views of Jesus and Christian ideas about Judas. At one point he notes: “Jesus and all his apostles were Jews and the children of Jews. But in the Christian imagination the only one remembered as a Jew . . . was Judas Iscariot.” Shmuel imagining Judas’s sorrow after the crucifixion fills a 13-page chapter that slides from third-person narration into a first-person confession in Judas’s voice. Jesus on the cross “wept, shouted and screamed with pain, calling over and over again for his mother, calling for her repeatedly in a shrill, piercing voice, like the crying of a fatally wounded infant abandoned in a field alone, parched with thirst as the last of its blood seeped out under the beating sun.”Throughout “Judas,” Shmuel’s thoughts on Jesus and Judas appear not as quotations but as exposition. Yet when Wald holds forth, his ideas are expressed and punctuated as dialogue — long tracts of it, happily indifferent to the conventional view that letting characters speechify makes them sound like talking heads. Wald’s monologues are enchanting, part of what makes “Judas” a successful novel of ideas. Oz doesn’t overdo it, though. By folding Shmuel’s thoughts into the text’s narrative fabric, he allows them to double as the character’s ideas and the novel’s own.",politics

Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee last year, whom Republicans refused to even consider at a hearing, saying the seat should be filled by the winner of the presidential election.But when it was his turn, Judge Gorsuch reached often for comity during a well-practiced 16-minute speech, insisting that he favored no party above the law and appearing to brace for attacks from critics who have said his rulings tilt toward corporate interests.“I’ve ruled for disabled students, for prisoners, for the accused, for workers alleging civil rights violations and for undocumented immigrants,” he told the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Sometimes, too, I’ve ruled against such persons.”",politics
"On March 8 women around the world will be abstaining from work and rallying in the streets as part of the International Women’s Strike, with the aim of starting an “international feminist movement” that challenges the sexual, physical and economic exploitation of women. The organizers of the wildly successful Women’s March have thrown their support behind the strike, and there are more than 40 rallies, walkouts and events planned across the United States that are affiliated with the international demonstration.As a proud and outspoken feminist who champions reproductive rights, equal pay, increased female representation in all levels of government and policies to combat violence against women, I would like to feel there is a place for me in the strike.However, as someone who is also a Zionist, I am not certain there is.Although I hope for a two-state solution and am critical of certain Israeli government policies, I identify as a Zionist because I support Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. Increasingly, I worry that my support for Israel will bar me from the feminist movement that, in aiming to be inclusive, has come to insist that feminism is connected to a wide variety of political causes.This insistence can alienate feminists, like myself, who don’t support all the causes others believe should be part of feminism. For example, some who identify as feminists may not agree with the organizers of the International Women’s Strike when they call for a $15 minimum wage. Nor do all feminists necessarily join the strike organizers in supporting the Dakota Access Pipeline protesters.",politics

Your story also does a disservice to the many other women who have represented administrations — and for that matter covered news — in equally charged situations.The criticism of Kellyanne Conway is all about Ms. Conway’s conduct and demeanor.

"When is politics like a tree?If you study and write about happiness as I do, you become attuned to patterns. For instance, when I walk into a workplace, I can usually tell, based on my first few conversations, if the environment is happy or not. And in the past couple of years, I have noticed a happiness pattern that relates to politics. Namely, the people most in the know tend to be unhappier than those who pay less attention.I subjected this observation to a bit of analysis, and sure enough, the numbers bear it out. I analyzed the 2014 data from the General Social Survey collected by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago to see how attention to politics is associated with life satisfaction. The results were significant. Even after controlling for income, education, age, gender, race, marital status and political views, being “very interested in politics” drove up the likelihood of reporting being “not too happy” about life by about eight percentage points.My results did not prove causality: People who pay close attention to politics might also tend to have some latent source of unhappiness. But behavioral science shows that the link might just be causal through what psychologists call “external locus of control,” which refers to a belief that external forces (such as politics) have a large impact on one’s life.An external locus of control brings unhappiness. Three social psychologists showed this in a famous 2004 paper published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Review. Studying surveys of college students over several decades and controlling for life circumstances and demographics, they compared people who associated their destinies with luck and outside forces with those who believed they were more in control of their lives. They conclude that an external locus is correlated with worse academic achievement, more stress and higher levels of depression.",politics

"Immigration is one issue that unites many chefs on either side of the political divide, said Michel Nischan, a registered Republican who in 2007 helped start Wholesome Wave, which began a program that doubles the value of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits at farmers’ markets. He also helped start the Beard Foundation policy boot camps.Image Jose Andres at a food and wine festival in Miami Beach. Credit Seth Browarnik“Frankly, the conservative chefs and the liberal chefs come down on the same place,” Mr. Nischan said. “It would be bad for business.”Edward Lee, a chef who owns three restaurants in Louisville, Ky., and Washington, said the issue went beyond business. Younger chefs in particular have grown up with a heightened awareness of civic responsibility. “You don’t really have a choice to be idle or neutral,” he said. “To me, politics has always been a means to an end of improving the community we live in, so I use my restaurants as a tool to do just that.”Mr. Lee donates to the local police department and to Christian charities. He supports a program to train young people from disadvantaged neighborhoods to cook, and another that offers services for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths. Recently, he bought 100 copies of the book “Why We March,” which raises money for Planned Parenthood. He is giving them away at his restaurant 610 Magnolia.For years, chefs have been hosting fund-raisers, cooking for charities and starting foundations. Mostly, their causes have been connected to food and farming issues. But over time, chefs began inserting themselves more directly into issues of governance, learning enough about the farm bill and nutrition policy to lobby local and national lawmakers.The political role for chefs grew stronger in 2010, when Michelle Obama invited more than 500 to the White House, asking that they lobby Congress to pass a stronger school nutrition bill and adopt a school in their communities in need of better lunches or a garden. Two years later, Tom Colicchio helped start Food Policy Action, the first chef-led political group to attend both national party conventions last year with the aim of making food policy a higher priority for lawmakers.Even chefs wanting nothing to do with politics or policy find themselves having to figure out where they stand on an increasing number of restaurant-related issues, including foie gras, calorie counts and concealed weapons.",politics
"What’s next on health care? Truly, I have no idea. The AHCA is a real stinker, and now everyone knows it; ordinarily, that should doom the legislation. But everyone also knows that starting off the Trump legislative era with the crashing and burning of Obamacare repeal would deeply damage Trump; nobody believes what he says, but if he can’t even ram bills through, people will stop being afraid. So they will pull out all the stops.But why are Republicans having so much trouble? Health reform is hard; but why were the Dems able to pass the ACA in the first place? I’m seeing a lot of talk about Paul Ryan’s inadequacy and Republican lack of preparation as compared with Pelosi and the Dems in 2009, all of which is true. But there’s a more fundamental issue: who is being served?Obamacare helped a large number of people at the expense of a small, affluent minority: basically, taxes on 2% of the population to cover a lot of people and assure coverage to many more. Trumpcare would reverse that, hurting a lot of people (many of whom voted Trump) so as to cut taxes for a handful of wealthy people. That’s a difference that goes beyond political strategy.But one way to say this is that Obamacare was and is a truly populist law, while Trumpcare is anti-populist. That’s reflected in the legislative struggles.And yet, and yet: Trump did in fact win over white working-class voters, who thought they were voting for a populist; Democrats, who did a lot for those voters, got no credit — rural whites, in particular, who were huge beneficiaries of the ACA, overwhelmingly supported the man who may destroy their healthcare.This ties in with an important recent piece by Zack Beauchamp on the striking degree to which left-wing economics fails, in practice, to counter right-wing populism; basically, Sandersism has failed everywhere it has been tried. Why?The answer, presumably, is that what we call populism is really in large degree white identity politics, which can’t be addressed by promising universal benefits. Among other things, these “populist” voters now live in a media bubble, getting their news from sources that play to their identity-politics desires, which means that even if you offer them a better deal, they won’t hear about it or believe it if told. For sure many if not most of those who gained health coverage thanks to Obamacare have no idea that’s what happened.That said, taking the benefits away would probably get their attention, and maybe even open their eyes to the extent to which they are suffering to provide tax cuts to the rich.In Europe, right-wing parties probably don’t face the same dilemma; they’re preaching herrenvolk social democracy, a welfare state but only for people who look like you. In America, however, Trumpism is faux populism that appeals to white identity but actually serves plutocrats. That fundamental contradiction is now out in the open.",politics

"BERLIN — The German capital on a sunny Sunday afternoon is about as laid-back a place as may be imagined. Couples lounge in the grass beside the Landwehr Canal in the Tiergarten, jugglers perform, kids on bikes in bright helmets zigzag through the throng.The city, it seems, has not a care in the world.Just back from the water there is a small memorial to Rosa Luxemburg, the socialist revolutionary murdered in 1919 by rightist paramilitaries. Her body was tossed in the canal. The murder presaged two decades in which Germany would be the crucible of a fierce struggle between left and right, Marxism and Fascism.Across Europe, opposing ideas vied for the minds of the masses tugged into cities by industrialization, radicalized by the devastation of war, polarized by the Bolshevik revolution in Moscow. Politics was the battleground of capital and labor, industry and the proletariat. Rightist revanchists confronted Marxists bent on wresting control of the means of production. The Weimar Republic, aptly described by the novelist Alfred Döblin as a political set-up lacking “proper instructions for use,” was never free of political violence. Out of it, in 1933, came Hitler and his marauding SA Brownshirts. It did not take them long to trash every independent institution and turn Germany into a lawless dictatorship.The Nazis’ first business was with the left — socialists and communists who, unlike Luxemburg, had survived. The first concentration camps, like Dachau, were filled with them. The battle of ideas had to be settled, the left extinguished. The Jewish question could be resolved later, even if Jewish leftists (or “Judeo-Bolsheviks” as the Nazis called them) were immediately the object of particular vitriol and violence, the fodder on which the SS prepared for the greater savagery to come.",politics
"When the Clintons last occupied the White House, Sidney Blumenthal cast himself in varied roles: speechwriter, in-house intellectual and press corps whisperer. Republicans added another, accusing Mr. Blumenthal of spreading gossip to discredit Republican investigators, and forced him to testify during President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial.Now, as Hillary Rodham Clinton embarks on her second presidential bid, Mr. Blumenthal’s service to the Clintons is again under the spotlight. Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, a Republican who is leading the congressional committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, plans to subpoena Mr. Blumenthal, 66, for a private transcribed interview.Mr. Gowdy’s chief interest, according to people briefed on the inquiry, is a series of memos that Mr. Blumenthal — who was not an employee of the State Department — wrote to Mrs. Clinton about events unfolding in Libya before and after the death of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. According to emails obtained by The New York Times, Mrs. Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, took Mr. Blumenthal’s advice seriously, forwarding his memos to senior diplomatic officials in Libya and Washington and at times asking them to respond. Mrs. Clinton continued to pass around his memos even after other senior diplomats concluded that Mr. Blumenthal’s assessments were often unreliable.But an examination by The Times suggests that Mr. Blumenthal’s involvement was more wide-ranging and more complicated than previously known, embodying the blurry lines between business, politics and philanthropy that have enriched and vexed the Clintons and their inner circle for years.",politics
"Social Security and Medicare consume more than 40 percent of federal spending. The trustees of the programs, beseeching lawmakers to shore up their finances, project that they will swell to 11.5 percent of the entire economy within 20 years, compared with 8.4 percent in 2013. Yet the debate in Washington has been frozen since President Obama and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, failed to strike a “grand bargain” on tax and spending levels.The pressures of the presidential campaign have revived the conversation. Gov.

"But Illinois has one of the most explicit constitutional pension guarantees of any state. The State Supreme Court found that the landmark plan was unconstitutional, and interpreted the clause in a way that protects even benefits that current public workers have not yet earned, as well as cost-of-living adjustments for retirees.That has made a dire situation worse and raised the possibility that Illinois, its biggest city and Chicago’s schools must all simultaneously find a way to keep running pension systems that are already unsustainable.“What has happened is the loudest wake-up call possible,” said Laurence J. Msall, president of the Civic Federation, a watchdog group. “This is a financial tsunami for the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois that will not be fixed without politically painful changes.”Many states and cities have been doing to a lesser degree what Illinois did: promising pensions without calculating the costs correctly or really preparing to pay them. Other states have pulled back from the brink of fiscal disaster through extraordinary measures, including New York in 1975, to deal with the threat of bankruptcy in New York City, and California in 2012, when Gov. Jerry Brown talked his famously tax-averse voters into approving a tax increase.But the Illinois public pension system is at or near the bottom of national rankings. Standard & Poor’s Rating Services said in 2014 that the Illinois system was last among state systems, with just 40 cents available for every dollar of promised benefits.The system sank over decades, as officials promised pensions without setting aside enough to pay them. In its unanimous opinion on May 8, the State Supreme Court cited commissions dating to 1917 that had warned of a crisis as more retired workers started drawing benefits.Warnings were ignored, though, and shortfalls accumulated. It was easy for officials to let that happen because actuarial calculations can understate the true cost of a pension plan, and Illinois had some of the biggest actuarial distortions of any state.

"“Part of this working mothers’ guilt has been, ‘Oh, my kids are going to be so much better off if I stay home,’ but what we’re finding in adult outcomes is kids will be so much better off if women spend some time at work,” said Kathleen McGinn, a professor at Harvard Business School and an author of the study, which is part of the school’s new gender initiative, to be announced Monday, for researching and discussing gender issues.“This is as close to a silver bullet as you can find in terms of helping reduce gender inequalities, both in the workplace and at home,” she said.Other researchers are less confident that the data has proved such a large effect, because it is difficult to know whether a mother who worked caused her daughter to work, or whether other factors were more influential. “The problem is we don’t know how these mothers differed,” said Raquel Fernandez, an economics professor at New York University who was not involved with the Harvard study but who has also studied the topic. “Was it really her mother working who did this, or was it her mother getting an education?”Either way, the new study is part of a shift away from focusing on whether working mothers hurt children and toward a richer understanding of the relationship between work and family. A 2010 meta-analysis of 69 studies over 50 years found that in general, children whose mothers worked when they were young had no major learning, behavior or social problems, and tended to be high achievers in school and have less depression and anxiety. The positive effects were particularly strong for children from low-income or single-parent families; some studies showed negative effects in middle-class or two-income families.Sons raised by working mothers were significantly more likely to have a wife who worked, one well-regarded study led by Ms. Fernandez found. The men might have preferred to marry a woman who worked, the researchers concluded, or were better partners at home to working wives. “If you want to work, the best way you might find a supportive environment for that is to marry a man whose mother worked,” she said.",politics
"A victory by Mr. Duda on Sunday would send an electric charge through Poland’s elite, and usher in the real prospect of a return later this year to a more right-wing, nationalistic government skeptical of stronger ties with the European Union and eager to take an even harder line against Russia.Mr. Komorowski had been expected to win re-election easily, and he ran what is widely seen as a lackluster campaign in the first round. By most accounts, Mr. Komorowski has engaged in a much more enthusiastic and combative second round, doing well in two televised debates.But it remains to be seen whether it will be enough to close the gap with Mr. Duda, whose campaign is slicker and shows more news media savvy, especially in a climate of growing voter disaffection.“His campaign thought that he would win easily, just like that,” Mr. Markowski said, and the lack of enthusiasm infected the ruling party’s supporters.The turnout in the first round was around 49 percent, the lowest in a presidential race since Poland emerged from communism in 1989. While the low turnout is being blamed largely on the sleepy first-round campaigns, another factor is that the two dominant parties come from the same side of the political spectrum.“One is conservative, and the other is very conservative,” Mr. Wasilewski said. “The people on the left have no candidate for whom they can vote with enthusiasm.”For Mr. Komorowski, this embarrassingly low turnout was both a curse and an opportunity.“Komorowski’s best chance now is to wake up the voters who doubted in him during the first round, the ones who didn’t want to go out to the polls,” Mr. Wasilewski said. “If he can get them to turn out, he wins.”",politics
"“The work we did was calling upon the memories of our grandparents’ stories — telling us how they hunted” animals, as well as what they looked like and how they ate them, said Rene Kulitja, who was at the camp with Ms. Hall and will be attending the biennale to speak about the project. She added that the works also incorporated Tjukurrpa, or ancient Aboriginal lore.Ms. Hall, who the women called “spidermaker” for the fantastical creatures she made at the camp, introduced camouflage fabric from British and Australian military uniforms to the women. This was subsequently woven into some of the animals, which were shown at the TarraWarra Biennial in Victoria last year before making their way to Venice.The camouflage fabric represents the old agonies of Aboriginal people, particularly what they see as their suffering under colonial rule, Ms. Hall said. This includes the fallout from secret British nuclear bomb tests conducted in the 1950s and ’60s in remote pockets of the Australian desert, including a tract of Aboriginal land in Maralinga, South Australia. A government inquiry was opened in 1984, which resulted in a report about Aboriginal people being exposed to radiation and the state’s failure to safely decontaminate sites.“A lot of us believe that when the atomic bomb testing was carried out, the fallout from those bombs came down onto the land and it killed off groups of animals,” Ms. Kulitja said. Many people also “got incredibly sick and many died.”Simon Mordant, Australia’s commissioner for the 2015 Venice Biennale, said “Kuka Irititja” is a central part of the exhibition. But he added that there were many facets to Ms. Hall’s work.The rest of the artist’s installation, curated by Linda Michael, uses a wide variety of materials, from bread sculptures to sardine tins and bronze casts. The notion behind the title “Wrong Way Time,” that the world is devolving, plays into such current issues as refugees dying in capsized boats in the Mediterranean, the destruction of Syrian communities in the civil war there and environmental degradation worldwide. “We are all being thrown together in ways that are unsettling and globally we’re not dealing with it very well,” Ms. Hall said.",politics
"PhotoGood Friday morning from Washington. The presidential campaign party heads to Iowa this weekend as Republicans look to woo activists in the crucial caucus state. Jeb Bush, who has yet to make his aspirations official, is hoping to move beyond a bad week, and Mitt Romney will step inside a different kind of ring when he faces off with a former boxing champion for charity.Mr. Bush picked a curious week to reveal he would be skipping the Iowa straw poll: just days before he arrives in Des Moines for a blowout dinner hosted by the straw poll’s sponsor, the Republican Party of Iowa.The straw poll, which is conducted on Aug. 8, is unloved by some candidates and strategists, but it is cherished by Iowa’s most hard-core Republican activists. On Saturday, about 1,300 of them will fill the state’s largest ballroom for the party’s annual Lincoln Dinner.Mr. Bush, who will get 10 minutes of floor time along with 10 other declared, likely and possible presidential candidates (hello, George E. Pataki), is certain to be the most talked-about figure.His appearance caps a week of excruciating moments on the campaign trail, as he answered, revised and re-revised whether he would have gone to war in Iraq. It raised the touchy issue of his relationship to his brother former President George W. Bush.Iowa presents another potentially awkward sibling comparison. Mr. Bush’s older brother won the 1999 straw poll on his road to the White House. Would-be supporters of Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor, expressed anxieties this week about his decision to tread much more lightly in the state.“I think he’s at real risk of laying an egg out here,” said Douglas E. Gross, a finance chairman for George W. Bush in Iowa.Tim Miller, a spokesman for Jeb Bush, said, “He will work hard to earn Iowans’ support” if he decides to run.Mr. Bush is also making two earlier stops on Saturday, in Dubuque for a meet-and-greet and in Iowa City for a $100 a ticket fund-raiser for Senator Charles E. Grassley.— Trip GabrielPresident Obama speaks at the National Peace Officers’ Memorial Service at the Capitol.Gov.

He told The Times’s Mark Leibovich, “I want to keep him very happy and very friendly” and warned, “I’m afraid the bird legs will be unveiled one more time.”Mr. Bush might have endured the worst week of anyone in politics as he got twisted in rhetorical knots trying to explain if he would have invaded Iraq.But will his about-face be enough to end the blowback?Perhaps for now, but fraternal questions are likely continue to dog Mr. Bush as he prepares to run for president. First Draft has come up with a few subjects he might be asked to consider.Was the expansion of Medicare’s prescription drug benefit that President Bush signed into law in 2003 a mistake?Would you support waterboarding as an interrogation technique?Would you have cut short your vacation to oversee the response to Hurricane Katrina?Do you think the National Security Agency should be able to eavesdrop on Americans and others in the United States without court-approved warrants?Would you have supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program, which bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis?Mr. Bush has largely dismissed questions about his brother’s administration by saying he is his own man, but the lesson of this week is that he will need a better answer.— Alan RappeportIt seemed like a partisan shot in recent years when Speaker John A. Boehner, frustrated the Democrat-controlled Senate hadn’t taken up one House bill or another, would complain that the House had done its job and that it was time for the Senate to act.As it turns out, it wasn’t a partisan divide; it is an institutional one between the House and Senate.Asked on Thursday whether the House would accept a short-term extension of antiterrorism surveillance laws if the Republican-led Senate failed to pass new House legislation next week, Mr. Boehner’s reply sounded very familiar: “It’s time for the Senate to act.”The looming standoff over the National Security Agency overhaul passed overwhelmingly by the House and supported by Mr. Boehner is shaping up as a serious test of the relationship between Mr. Boehner and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.Mr. McConnell, the majority leader, wants nothing to do with the House legislation and on Thursday took steps to gain a two-month extension of current laws despite a new court decision challenging their validity.

He has superimposed the senator’s head on a cutout of Hugh Jackman‘s shirtless body in an attempt at a joke about “X-Men.” And when Mr. Paul’s presidential campaign announcement ran a little too long for Mr. Stewart’s tastes, he suggested a backup profession should politics not work out: producing the Oscars.But Mr. Paul, who is a strong believer in the “it’s far better to be talked about than not” school of media strategy, likes all the attention. And in two weeks, he will appear as a guest on Mr. Stewart’s program as the comedian winds down toward his final episode in August.The purpose is to plug Mr. Paul’s new book, “Taking a Stand,” which comes out May 26. In it, he traces his political evolution from his childhood growing up as the son of Ron Paul, the libertarian hero, to his unexpected victory to the Senate.“The Daily Show” may seem an odd move for a senator who often rails against the sins of the “liberal media elite” (though he did appear on the program in 2013).One thing seems certain: Mr. Stewart won’t tolerate any of Mr. Paul’s media bashing. This year, Mr. Stewart offered this scalding admonition: “You’re a doctor and a senator, with a 12-term congressman father and a first name synonymous with a Russian novelist?”That’s pretty elite, he said, using saltier language.— Jeremy W.

"NAIROBI, Kenya — As I thought about the recent violence in the Central African nation of Burundi, I recalled a trip I made there three years ago. I realized that something I’d seen in 2012 was a key to why the coup attempt in May by a group of army officers had failed.The capital city, Bujumbura, is bordered by hills that roll down toward Lake Tanganyika. At first sight, the lake, which is estimated to be the second largest freshwater body in the world, is stunningly beautiful. But the illusion of a paradise soon ended when I visited the beaches. They were littered with garbage, the shoreline so polluted that fishermen had to venture far from shore to catch fish.A short drive away, though, is one of the exclusive resorts you’d expect to find, given the setting: the Hotel Club du Lac Tanganyika. During my visit, at least, few of the guests were tourists. Instead, the hotel was bustling with American and European military advisers.The reason these trainers were in town was because Burundi was supplying troops to the African Union’s peacekeeping force in Somalia, known by its acronym, Amisom. In 2007, an African Union resolution established the Somalia mission. Uganda, always gung-ho in military matters, was the first to send in forces. Then, to the surprise of many, Burundi contributed more than 5,000 soldiers.",politics
"Since then, interpretations of yoga have multiplied. A number of practitioners, both in India and abroad, view it purely as a set of exercises. At the other end of the spectrum are Shiva devotees aiming for moksha, or liberation from the cycle of life and death, through intense meditation and asceticism. Somewhere in the middle lie New Age variations, the ones with incense and mantras and piped-in incantations of the sacred Hindu word “om,” swirling around yoga studios like stereophonic movie-theater-sound logos.What’s striking about Mr. Modi’s grand project, given his formative years in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a right-wing Hindu organization, is the presentation of yoga as a secular activity. His government takes great pains to point out that 47 Muslim nations supported his United Nations resolution. In his United Nations address, he characterized yoga as “an invaluable gift of ancient Indian tradition,” rather than Hindu tradition.Mr. Modi’s careful scripting shows him to be a consummate businessman. By presenting yoga as one of the monumental achievements of Indian thought, he is increasing the country’s visibility, promoting its brand on the world market. He will not allow the distraction of religion to interfere with the return on his investment.Yoga is big business, estimated at $10 billion a year in the United States alone, and India needs to be associated with it — not just to attract tourists to yoga retreats, but also to assert its intellectual rights. The country has been fighting attempts by Western gurus to patent yoga poses, assembling a repository of over 1,500 asanas to keep them free.Within India, the goal is different. Those on the Hindu right have always harbored the vision of returning to India’s greatness as an ancient civilization. A practice with Vedic origins that has nevertheless attained such secular popularity is the perfect vehicle to create a shared national consciousness. The physical engagement, mental discipline and sublimation of desire enshrined in yoga meld seamlessly, yet discreetly, with the more militaristic tenets of organizations like Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.The churlish might question whether huge public rallies can be conducive to the quiet spiritual advancement that yoga promises, or whether the pollution generated in transporting all those participants to their Sunday events helps us deal with climate change, as Mr. Modi claims yoga will do. But that would be missing the point, which is to demonstrate that the prime minister can mobilize such large tracts of India’s population, that he possesses the assertiveness and authority needed to bring together such a diverse and willful people.",politics
"As a researcher who has interviewed him half a dozen times over the past decade, I can attest to his striking capacity, born of a career in intelligence, to say what his listener most wants to hear. It is easy to leave an initial interview convinced that he is the peacemaker and democratizer Guatemala needs. But as you measure his words against his deeds over time, you figure out that Mr. Pérez Molina is a master of manipulation.He is playing the United States now. It is nonsensical to assume that a president who has tolerated, if not reaped the benefits of, a thoroughly corrupt administration is suddenly willing to purge it.Furthermore, it requires a tremendous leap of imagination to accept that the president has no ties to the scheme involving the customs fraud. That network initially emerged during Guatemala’s 36-year civil war, and its key players include several members of the military with close ties to Mr. Pérez Molina.American support for Mr. Pérez Molina has bought him time to consolidate an unholy alliance with the equally, if not more corrupt, major opposition party, which has set its sights on winning the coming elections. The criminal networks that control politics also seem to have reaffirmed their influence over the judicial system: Last week the Constitutional Court blocked an investigation into whether to strip the president of immunity from prosecution.What’s needed, and is unlikely to happen under Mr. Pérez Molina, is real reform: banning private funding for political parties, guarantees of equal media access and the establishment of quotas for candidates who are indigenous people or women. Absent reform, elections would hand-deliver a mandate to the opposition and usher in another four years of Guatemalan politics controlled by a criminal mafia. The only real chance for such reform lies with a minority in Congress, outsider candidates for election and the demonstrators themselves.Guatemalans have long historical memories. Their vision of the United States continues to be shaped by the C.I.A.-sponsored coup in 1954 that interrupted an initial democratic spring and triggered decades of armed conflict. After years of painstaking efforts to repair relations between the United States and Guatemalan society, Guatemalans are angrily pointing their fingers at the United States, which they see as either propping up an increasingly illegitimate Guatemalan government or treading with excessive caution, refraining from using its substantial influence to move democracy forward.Second chances rarely happen. Yet the United States is being offered one now. By publicly aligning itself with the diverse coalition of Guatemalan citizens seeking immediate democratic reforms, the United States has an opportunity to bolster a democracy that Guatemalans deserve and lay the foundation for a constructive relationship with an emerging Guatemalan political class. In helping regenerate a Guatemalan democratic spring, this time the United States can unequivocally stand on the right side of history.",politics

"Instead, researchers say, interviewers should look for collegiality and a commitment to the business’s strategy and values. “A cultural fit is an individual whose work-related values and style of work support the business strategy,” said Lauren Rivera, who studies hiring at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. “When you get into a lot of the demographic characteristics, you’re not only moving away from that definition but you’re also getting into discrimination.”They recommend that companies use structured interviews, in which they ask the same questions of every candidate and assign tasks that simulate on-the-job work — and rely on data.Gild, for instance, uses employers’ own data and publicly available data from places like LinkedIn or GitHub to find people whose skills match those that companies are looking for. It tries to calculate the likelihood that people would be interested in a job and suggests the right time to contact them, based on the trajectory of their company and career.Mr. Desai said that Gild finds more diverse candidates than employers typically do. In tech, it surfaces more engineers who are women and older and who come from a wider variety of colleges and socioeconomic backgrounds. “If you have white, young male engineers, who are they going to know?” Mr. Desai said. “White, young male engineers.” More than 80 percent of the technical employees at most tech companies are men, and less than 5 percent are black or Latino.One engineer had applied twice to Rackspace, a cloud computing company, without luck. As an Army veteran who worked in public radio with no high school degree or professional programming experience, he did not fit the pattern that Rackspace looked for. But Gild suggested him based on the software he had been writing on his own, and he was hired.The tech industry is a focus for some of the hiring start-ups in part because it has more jobs than it can fill, and tech companies are under pressure to make their work forces more diverse. At Twitter, for instance, just 10 percent of technical employees are women, and at Facebook and Yahoo, it’s around 15 percent. Some women and minorities in tech describe an unwelcoming culture, and in response to the criticism, tech companies have begun publishing their diversity data and pledging to make changes.Some of the software sounds as touchy-feely as the most empathetic personnel director. Doxa, a new service, plans to match candidates with tech companies and even specific teams and managers based on skills, values and compatibility — like whether a team has more solo work or collaboration, or whether women feel that their opinions are taken seriously. “There are just so many limitations to the human part of hiring, and the way we’re doing it now isn’t working because people are unhappy with work,” said Nathalie Miller, chief executive and co-founder of Doxa.",politics
"Campaigns are “the fastest start-ups in the world,” as Matt McDonald, a former McKinsey consultant who worked on the 2008 John McCain effort and other Republican campaigns, calls them in a new report with that title issued by Hamilton Place Strategies, the Washington public affairs firm where he is a partner. He points out that hot social media companies may attain multibillion-dollar paper valuations quickly but take years to reach a scale equivalent to a major presidential campaign in spending and employee count.A serious candidate for president, after all, requires a high-functioning team that is built from scratch in just a few months. That typically means appointing a campaign manager who may have a background as a political strategist but who becomes de facto chief executive of a complicated enterprise that has little time to evolve. Start-ups and campaigns are both driven by people with a range of motives: an idealistic desire to change the world along with less noble goals of attaining a great fortune or power.An enormous staff must be assembled, learn how to work together and execute intricate and interrelated tasks. Among them are raising vast sums of money and developing and executing what is essentially an enormous marketing campaign. In the end, of course, participants hope to persuade millions of people to “buy” — meaning, show up at the polls and vote for the candidate on Election Day.“A lot of start-ups and a lot of campaigns are similar,” said David Plouffe, the manager of Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, who is now chief adviser at the fast-growing transportation upstart Uber. “Decisions need to be made, and there are new challenges every day, while at the same time you’re trying to hire a lot of people and scale an organization.”Ken Mehlman, who headed George W. Bush’s 2004 re-election campaign and is now an executive at the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, sees similar challenges. “I viewed my job as being the C.E.O. of a company that in the beginning was a start-up, and was ultimately a very large company,” he said. “My underlying thesis is that my job wasn’t to be a political genius. My job was to take best management practices and apply them to politics.”",politics
"The Supreme Court’s decision affirming the right to same-sex marriage across the United States is a joyous moment for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. Recognition of our equal dignity, and of our right to the same legal protections straight couples enjoy, is a civil rights milestone. But it could also be the swan song for the movement for gay freedom that began after World War II.It is unfortunate that the movement’s two great victories of the last decade — the right to serve openly in the military and the right to be married — have come as progress has stalled or reversed in so many other areas of civil rights: equal pay and reproductive choice for women; housing and school segregation; police violence against minorities; and the prospects of a decent wage and a modicum of job and retirement security for all.It is no accident that the one civil rights law that would likely apply to the greatest numbers of gays — a ban on discrimination in employment and housing on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity — continues to elude us. An anti-discrimination law creates substantial costs not only for the government, which must enforce it, but also for corporations, which must comply with it; letting gays into military service and into the institution of marriage does not. Indeed, 379 employers, including many of the nation’s largest airlines, banks, health insurers and manufacturers, filed a brief in support of same-sex marriage, arguing that inconsistency in marriage laws created an onerous regulatory and financial burden and hurt their efforts to recruit talent.After Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage, in 2003, a backlash of ballot initiatives and referendums banning such unions swept much of the country. In response, many lesbians and gay men who were uninterested in marrying put aside their doubts for the cause.",politics
"There have been a number of interesting comments related to the new Gallup data showing America’s socially-liberal shift continuing apace, but before I get to them I want to offer one more word on the data point I plucked out for my Sunday column: The appreciable increase in public acceptance of polygamy.In my column, I argued that this (still on the margins) shift was of a piece with other liberalizing trends, not only on same-sex marriage but also on divorce and unwed childbearing and assisted suicide and more, while also noting that polygamy is distinctive within that issue set because its most famous practitioners often belong to deeply illiberal religious communities. This last point was picked up by Mark Silk at Religion News, who used it to reach for a “gotcha” against what he apparently sees as my right-wing fearmongering:I’d have thought the principled position for Douthat would be to support a right to polygamy, along the religious freedom lines that he thinks are necessary to enable traditionalist believers to maintain their codes of conduct. Indeed, it would be interesting to know how many of those new supporters of polygamy are frequent churchgoers and how many not, or how many are Republicans and how many Democrats. Crosstabs, Gallup? What’s certain is that the federal judge who threw out a hunk of Utah’s anti-polygamy law is a born-and-bred Mormon whose decision turned on the constitutional right of free exercise. If polygamy is to achieve legal recognition in 21st-century America, it won’t be because of what Douthat calls “the now-ascendant model of marriage as a gender-neutral and easily-dissolved romantic contract.” It will be because of the increasingly robust view of religious liberty now being embraced by him and his kind.So, a few thoughts (speaking for myself and not necessarily for my “kind”). First, I agree with Silk that there’s a reasonable religious liberty case against prosecuting and otherwise harassing polygamists, especially if and when the laws being enforced are still-on-the-books prohibitions against adultery or cohabitation that would never be enforced except to target religiously-motivated plural marriages. In point of fact, anti-polygamy laws are already mostly only enforced in cases where prosecutors are trying to break up a cult, but even with figures like Warren Jeffs you could argue that existing laws against sexual assault, statutory rape, human trafficking and so on should suffice without bringing polygamy into it. And then from a political-legal perspective it’s certainly possible that as religious conservatives find themselves more marginalized they’ll end up accepting fundamentalist Mormons as strange bedfellows in “leave-us-alone” arguments; at the very least, social conservatives may end up with more sympathy for the position of 19th century Mormons vis-a-vis that era’s social consensus once today’s consensus has finished settling into place.All of this is part of what makes the issue of polygamy so distinctive and interesting, and my limited agreement with Silk reflects the fact that I really was writing (believe it or not!) about polygamy’s prospects in a spirit of curiosity rather than sky-is-falling polemic. On the list of cultural indicators I’m concerned about, the mainstreaming of polygamy is just a small part of the pantomime, not some uniquely Terrifying Destination to be invoked against liberalism’s intended path. Frankly, we’re well past that kind of invocation; now it’s just time to see how the pantomime plays out.However: With all of that said, Silk’s argument elides the important distinction between legal tolerance of polygamy and legal recognition — “marriage equality” for the plurally-inclined. The former might indeed be furthered, as he suggests, by religious liberty arguments, but the latter possibility is only likely to be realized if current progressive arguments about marriage’s elastic, affection-based definition are more comprehensively applied. That is, a court decision striking down Utah’s polygamy statute can rely on religious-liberty arguments, sure … but if we ever get a court decision ordering states to issue marriage licenses with space for three or four or five names, that decision will almost-inevitably rely on whatever language the Supreme Court ends up issuing in this year’s same-sex marriage case. There’s a religious liberty argument for tolerance, but the road to recognition (if we take it) runs through the new model or marriage, not the old.And then relatedly, I would hoist an eyebrow at Silk’s suggestion that polygamy’s current progress toward social acceptance might be happening primarily or even partially among Republicans and churchgoers. Maybe the crosstabs would prove me wrong, but the Gallup movement tracks so closely with the broader leftward movement on a range of social issues (including other outlier issues like human cloning) that it’s very hard to imagine it representing some of religious-liberty-oriented reaction rather than just another manifestation of expressive individualism’s progress. It’s equally hard to imagine if you actually know any churchgoers or Republicans, if you ponder the longstanding evangelical hostility to both Mormonism and Islam, if you pay attention to where recent pro-polygamy arguments tend to appear and who tends to make them (hint: not social conservatives), and so on. Religious conservatives may not end up marshaling much effective opposition to the recognition of polygamy if it becomes a live debate, but they aren’t likely to be the people who actually support it.Again, this is part of why polygamy’s politics are interesting: Because it’s found (limited, for now) public support in libertarian and left-wing circles despite being practiced in some of the least left-libertarian circles imaginable. And this unusual bridging of deep-fundamentalist sectarian practice and further-left ideology is part of why the future trend on this issue is so hard to predict. Will the constituency for a secular, liberal polygamy gradually increase, as it has to some modest (though perhaps sometimes overhyped) extent already? Put another way, will the growing acceptance of polyamory as a model for nonmarital relationships — I have at least one friend in an explicitly “polyamorous” dating situation, and I’m not even a millennial! — eventually translate into more experiments in actual plural marriage, and thus more demand for legal recognition? Or will institutional polygamy always remain too fringe (and too associated with patriarchal exploitation and abuse) to have the constituency needed to push liberal courts into action?As I said in the column, I can see it playing out both ways: I’m sure we’ll have more legal and social tolerance for plural marriage, but I can argue both sides of the legal recognition point. It seems like a case, if you’ll forgive my revising a cliche, of a resistible force facing an extremely moveable object: The percentage of Americans personally invested in recognizing polygamy is likely to remain smaller than the percentage invested in recognizing same-sex marriage, but the current majority coalition against the recognition of polygamy doesn’t look particularly strong or well-entrenched, since its centrist element is trending libertarian and its religious-conservative element is facing increasing marginalization. Hence my suggestion that the recognition of polygamy could happen mostly through indifference, or as a necessarily corollary of some larger leftward push on marriage and family law. Not with a bang, in other words, but with a shrug.",politics

Then, mocking Mr. Trump’s invitation to a voter on Thursday in South Carolina to pull his hair to prove its authenticity, she said, “If anyone wonders if mine is real, here’s the answer: The hair is real, the color isn’t.” Letting the laughter die down, she added, “And come to think of it, I wonder if that’s true for Donald, too.”Turning from smiling to stern, she continued: “You hear Mr. Trump say hateful things about immigrants, even about their babies. But how many others disagree with him, or support a real path to citizenship, or draw the line at repealing the 14th Amendment?”Mrs. Clinton also presented herself as the candidate whose coattails other Democrats could ride into office in 2016. Some Democrats have criticized President Obama for allowing the party to grow weaker and less well financed; Mrs. Clinton tacitly alluded to that when she pledged to help elect more Democrats to state legislatures so that they could reshape congressional districts to keep Democrats from being “routed” in the future as they were in 2010.Mr. O’Malley’s raw speech, met by cheers, startled Democrats both inside the meeting and watching it on television.Accusing the party of trying to keep its own ideas hidden as the Republican candidates spew “racist hate” from their debate lecterns, Mr. O’Malley questioned Democrats’ decision to hold “four debates and four debates only” before the first four states finish voting.“This is totally unprecedented in our party’s history,” he said. “This sort of rigged process has never been attempted before. Whose decree is it exactly? Where did it come from? To what end? For what purpose? What national or party interest does this decree serve? How does this help us tell the story of the last eight years of Democratic progress?”",politics
"IT shows how gifted Jon Stewart is that his best moment happened on someone else’s show. He appeared in 2004 on “Crossfire,” a CNN yelling program, and asked the hosts to take seriously their responsibility to public understanding by having useful conversations instead of shouting matches.It was Mr. Stewart’s finest hour. He made an earnest pitch for civility in a place where there really was none. Which makes it too bad that in his 16 years of hosting “The Daily Show,” he never lived up to his own responsibility. His prodigious talents — he was smart and funny, and even more of both when he was mad — perfectly positioned him to purge a particular smugness from our discourse. Instead, he embodied it. I loved watching him, and hated it too.Many liberals, but not conservatives, believe there is an important asymmetry in American politics. These liberals believe that people on opposite sides of the ideological spectrum are fundamentally different. Specifically, they believe that liberals are much more open to change than conservatives, more tolerant of differences, more motivated by the public good and, maybe most of all, smarter and better informed.The evidence for these beliefs is not good. Liberals turn out to be just as prone to their own forms of intolerance, ignorance and bias. But the beliefs are comforting to many. They give their bearers a sense of intellectual and even moral superiority. And they affect behavior. They inform the condescension and self-righteousness with which liberals often treat conservatives. They explain why many liberals have greeted Tea Partiers and other grass-roots conservatives with outsize alarm. They explain why liberals fixate on figures such as Sarah Palin and Todd Akin, who represent the worst that many liberals are prepared to see in conservatives. These liberals often end up sounding like Jon Lovitz, on “Saturday Night Live,” impersonating Michael Dukakis in 1988, gesturing toward the Republican and saying “I can’t believe I’m losing to this guy!” This sense of superiority is hardly the only cause of our polarized public discourse, but it sure doesn’t help.",politics
"Very little appears to link Jeremy Corbyn, who has emerged from nowhere to become the favorite to lead the British Labour Party, with Donald Trump, the equally surprising front-runner for the Republican nomination.Corbyn is a slight, quiet, parsimonious radical leftist who is anti-money, anti-meat, anti-war and pro-nationalization of banks. He has, to put it mildly, deep misgivings about America. Trump is a large, loud, self-promoting businessman who is pro-money, pro-market and wants to “Make America Great Again” by unleashing its animal entrepreneurial spirit and putting the red meat back in political discourse clogged by political correctness. He has spoken approvingly of John Bolton, hawk of neocon hawks among Republican foreign policy officials.But the two men do have a couple of things in common. Both opposed the Iraq war (Trump thought Mexico might be a more sensible target). More importantly, both speak their minds at a time when a lot of people in Britain and the United States have had it with politics as usual and the mealy-mouthed, finger-to-the-wind calibration of the political persona.Rupert Murdoch recently tweeted that Corbyn would probably triumph in the Labour Party leadership election for this reason: “Corbyn increasingly likely Labor winner. Seems only candidate who believes anything, right or wrong.” The result is to be announced Sept. 12 (elections in Britain are not multiyear affairs as in the United States).",politics
"PhotoGood Friday morning. The Iran nuclear deal has been making its way back to the Capitol during summer break, even if Congress has not, and it will be a focus of several events. But the big party is with the Democrats as they meet in Minneapolis to hear the candidates try to curry favor with the party’s leaders.The summer meeting of the Democratic National Committee gets down to business on Friday with speeches by four of the party’s presidential candidates — Lincoln Chafee, the former Rhode Island governor, and Hillary Rodham Clinton in the morning, Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor, and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the afternoon – to hundreds of activists who are plenty familiar with their political speeches and policy views. So will the contenders say anything new or surprising?Mr. Sanders, for one, was playing around with ideas on a yellow legal pad as he flew to Minneapolis on Thursday, according to Democrats on the plane with him. Like the other candidates, he has only about 10 minutes to speak, but advisers expect him to make a sincere pitch — even if he is not a Democrat, but an independent — as an outsider who is attracting big crowds.“He will say if Democrats want to keep the White House,” said Michael Briggs, Mr. Sanders’s campaign spokesman, “then establishment politics won’t do it.”“Few would deny he is generating excitement, and that’s what the party needs.”Mr. O’Malley has been arguing that the current plan for only six debates favors Mrs. Clinton, who is leading in the polls. Several Democrats said they were curious if Mr. O’Malley would press for more debates in his speech — and whether he would do so politely or pugnaciously.The party leaders are convening as Mrs. Clinton’s dominance in the race is shadowed by her email practices as secretary of state, and amid uncertainty about whether Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will enter the race.As for Mrs. Clinton, this is her crowd: Many in the audience are already planning to support her. Democrats expect her to rally the base and rip into Republicans — which won’t be all that surprising, but will sure make people there feel good.— Patrick HealyStay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates.Charleston, S.C., is to be the scene of two tough-talking foreign policy addresses by Republicans, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin.Mr. Rubio plans to take aim at China, as concern grows about Beijing’s devaluations of its currency and the steep declines in markets that have reverberated to Wall Street.His remarks come a week before China’s president, Xi Jinping, visits Washington to meet President Obama. Mr. Walker, who has called on the White House to cancel Mr. Xi’s visit, will focus his speech mostly on the Middle East. He will draw a contrast with what he considers weakness by Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, and will call for a rejection of the Iran nuclear deal.“As president, I will send the following message: The retreat is over,” Mr. Walker plans to say, according to an advance text.He will criticize the idea of engaging at all with Iran across a negotiating table.Instead, he will call for an American defeat of Iranian “theocrats” and Islamic State “barbarians,” as necessary to deter Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and the Chinese in the South China Sea.“We’ve had enough of a president who proclaims that the greatest threat to future generations is climate change,” the prepared text says.As part of his efforts to press for the approval of the nuclear deal, Mr. Obama will speak via a webcast to an event co-sponsored by the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations and the Jewish Federations of North America.— Trip Gabriel and Gerry MullanyThough Mrs. Clinton’s campaign has been dogged by the questions about her email use, she has moved this week to highlight her strength before the Democratic National Committee meeting, including receiving an emotional endorsement from an old friend.Tom Vilsack, the secretary of agriculture who says he owes his career to Mrs. Clinton for her help in his Iowa governor’s race in 1998, endorsed her on Tuesday and joined her on Wednesday in Iowa, introducing her in a way that could serve as a counterpoint to some voter perceptions of her as untrustworthy.The rollout of the endorsement, and memos released by the Clinton team on Thursday detailing her organizational power in early voting states, are gestures that many see as timed to the party meeting and to Mr. Biden’s 2016 deliberations.But, to Mr. Vilsack, it was personal.“This introduction means a lot to me,” he told a crowd in Sioux City.He recalled how Mrs. Clinton had recently told him how concerned she was about drug addiction and mental health in the country. It struck a chord.“I was adopted into a family where my mom suffered alcohol and prescription drug addiction,” he said. “And, on one very sad occasion, she tried to take her own life.”Mr. Vilsack recalled how the last conversation he had with his father before he died was about the cost of law school, then noted Mrs. Clinton’s plan for easing student debt.And, he said, “she understands loyalty.” She first took interest in him and his fledgling campaign in 1998, he said, “24 years before that, she met my brother-in-law.”“It was that friendship that got her interested in my race,” Mr. Vilsack said. And then, “introducing my friend to my friends,” he handed the microphone to Mrs. Clinton.— Nick CorasanitiDonald J. Trump said in an interview on Thursday that he would soon decide whether to sign a pledge to support the ultimate Republican presidential nominee, something the South Carolina Republican Party is requiring to compete in the state’s critical primary.Carly Fiorina, who has been gaining in polls and was widely seen as the winner of the second-tier Republican debate this month, is pressing party leaders in an effort to secure a spot in the prime-time debate in September.And Mrs. Clinton and the Democratic National Committee have finalized a joint fund-raising agreement after months of difficult negotiations, opening the door for the party to gain a significant head start on Republicans at roping in big checks from donors.On the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Obama, who has cited such severe storms in his push on climate change proposals — and separately faced some criticism from environmental groups on Thursday, visited New Orleans to make a case for his entire presidency: that when disaster strikes, the federal government should help not only to rescue the stranded but also to rebuild better and fairer than before.Planned Parenthood gave congressional leaders and a committee that is investigating allegations of criminality at its clinics an analysis it commissioned concluding that “manipulation” of undercover videos by abortion opponents make those recordings unreliable for any official inquiry.And Mrs. Clinton compared some of the Republican presidential candidates’ views on women to those of terrorist groups, citing in particular stances against abortion even in the cases of rape or incest, and calls to defund all services of Planned Parenthood.They’ve shared a private meeting in New York, the debate stage, and now, they will share a podium in Washington.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas has invited Mr. Trump to join him to lead a rally calling on Congress to vote against the Iran nuclear deal.The event will be on Sept. 9, a week before the next Republican debate.“Senator Cruz has invited Donald Trump to join him on the Capitol grounds for a rally to call on members of Congress to defeat the catastrophic deal that the Obama administration has struck with the Islamic Republic of Iran,” the Cruz campaign said in a statement emailed to reporters. “The event will be sponsored by Tea Party Patriots, Center for Security Policy and the Zionist Organization of America.”A joint appearance has long been in the works, according to Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for the Cruz campaign, “and this event rallying against the Iran deal is an important issue and perfect chance to partner together.”Mr. Cruz did not extend the invite to any of the other Republican candidates, despite some, like Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, taking strong positions in opposition to the deal.Inviting Mr. Trump, who leads Republican polls, gives Mr. Cruz a near-guaranteed large crowd and extensive media coverage. Mr. Cruz has also been one of the few Republican candidates who have declined to criticize Mr. Trump over some of his more caustic comments.— Nick CorasanitiMr. Trump‘s news conference argument with Jorge Ramos of Univision this week — Mr. Trump said Mr. Ramos was asking questions without being called on; Mr. Ramos said Mr. Trump was refusing to answer tough questions — drove a fair amount of traffic on television, online and in print. But, Time Magazine writes, Mr. Ramos says Mr. Trump is not the only one at fault: Speaking of the national media, “’He hasn’t been challenged enough,’ Ramos said of Trump. ‘He hates to be challenged, and it is time that we start doing it.'”And NPR takes a look at Mr. Sanders, who considers himself to be a Democratic socialist, and “the S-word,” which “is not a word Sanders often uses on the campaign trail to define himself.”Who would give money to Mr. Trump‘s campaign? Politico looked and found that “63 people contributed $250 or more in the first two weeks after Trump announced.””Ten of them have already ‘maxed out,’ meaning they’ve given the legal contribution limit for a federal primary election, $2,700,” Politico reports.The animosity between Mr. Trump and Jeb Bush is rooted in decades of tensions between the billionaire and the Bush family. “There are clashes of style, manner and class between the Bushes — a patrician clan of presidents, governors and financiers who have pulled the levers of power for generations — and Trump, a hustling New York City deal-maker who turned his father’s outer-borough real estate portfolio into a gold-plated empire,” The Washington Post writes.",politics
"WASHINGTON — The shape of the Republican presidential nomination race and the fate of the traditional New Hampshire primary were crystallized by three town hall meetings in the state last week.Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio, at the Derry-Salem Elks Lodge in Salem, and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, at the Historical Society of Cheshire County in Keene, each had healthy give-and-take sessions with more than 100 voters that lasted over an hour. These were in the tradition of New Hampshire politics.In between those forums, Donald J. Trump packed an auditorium in the town of Derry with 20 times as many people for a gathering that more closely resembled an angry revival meeting or a professional wrestling match.For more than a half-century, New Hampshire has been a proving ground for vetting and testing presidential hopefuls, forcing them to hone their political and policy knowledge. If the Trump model prevails, it not only could change the fabric of the party but also could spell an end to this substantive, searching type of retail politics.",politics
"If Greece’s European creditors think the resignation of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will improve their leverage over Athens, they best think again. First, there is no telling what the new wave of political tumult in the struggling nation will bring, and it is entirely possible that Mr. Tsipras will return as prime minister of a stronger coalition.Endlessly lending Greece more money to pay off old debts helps neither Europe nor Greece, no matter who is running the country. As the International Monetary Fund has finally and publicly acknowledged, Greece can never repay its 300-billion-euro debt, and putting off a restructuring will only add to the agony of the Greeks, discord in the European Union and the likelihood of a Greek default.Given that his scant seven months in office were one continuing crisis, it is hard to judge how good a prime minister Mr. Tsipras was or could have been. A hard-core leftist, he promised things he could never deliver, like abandoning the austerity regime that has pushed Greece into a depression. He tried everything to sway the creditors — brinkmanship, bombast and a snap referendum on July 5, in which 61.3 percent of Greeks voted to reject the terms of the latest bailout. None of that worked, and in the end Mr. Tsipras was forced to accept the latest terms.The resulting defection of the radical wing of his Syriza party left Mr. Tsipras with no choice but to seek new elections. That is not easy in Greece, since other major parties must be given a chance to form a government after a prime minister resigns. But the current political arithmetic makes a new election, possibly as early as Sept. 20, all but inescapable.",politics
"PhotoGood Wednesday morning from Washington. Democrats are quietly counting their Iran votes, and President Obama remains on vacation, hoping things stay as unexciting as possible. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida is getting some attention for his throwing arm, while several other Republicans are heading to New Hampshire to talk education.The Republican presidential contest will shift its debate from immigration to education policy on Wednesday, as several candidates gather in New Hampshire to discuss the future of schools.The news site The Seventy Four, which was created by former television journalist Campbell Brown, will hold a first-of-its-kind public forum featuring about a third of the extensive Republican field: Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Bobby Jindal, Carly Fiorina, Scott Walker and John R. Kasich. The event can be viewed live.Ms. Brown has become an advocate of overhauls to the education system, including changes to the teacher evaluation systems that are part of union contracts. For Mr. Bush, education policy has been a signature issue over the last decade, and the forum gives him a chance to highlight those credentials.But within the Republican contest, education policy has become a fraught topic, particularly around the Common Core education standards. Mr. Bush favors those standards, which many conservative voters oppose.Unlike in a debate format with a 60-second response time, Mr. Bush may have more of an opportunity to explain his views. As for Mr. Christie and Mr. Walker, who both had high-profile fights with the teachers’ unions in their respective states, the format will most likely let them showcase their claims to the education battle.— Maggie HabermanStay tuned throughout the day: Follow us on Twitter @NYTpolitics and on Facebook for First Draft updates.Donald J.

There has been no international crisis. No domestic upheaval. No budget standoff. No looming epidemic or storm.For once, Mr. Obama has been free to golf, have long dinners with friends, take walks with his children and hang out at the beach. There have been no briefings by White House officials. There have been no on-camera presidential statements.That’s rarely been the case.In 2009, during his first trip to Martha’s Vineyard as president, Mr. Obama was forced to skip off the island to deliver a eulogy for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who passed away on Aug. 25 that year. Mr. Obama had already interrupted his vacation once that year to reappoint Ben S. Bernanke as the chairman of the Federal Reserve.Last year, the first week of Mr. Obama’s vacation was consumed by riots in Ferguson, Mo., and the escalation of fighting against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Just days after he arrived here in 2014, Mr. Obama confirmed the beheading of James Foley, an American journalist, in a live statement from an elementary school here. The White House later announced that an earlier rescue operation had failed.This time, Mr. Obama is past the halfway mark in his vacation without a crisis. He went to the beach with his family on Tuesday and is likely to watch the island’s annual fireworks on Friday.Unless something jinxes things.— Michael D. ShearSenator Robert Menendez on Tuesday delivered a blistering critique of the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by the Obama administration, saying in a speech at Seton Hall University in New Jersey that “if Iran is to acquire a nuclear bomb, it will not have my name on it.”His position on the agreement was no surprise since Mr. Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, has long since telegraphed his opposition. Neither was his tone since he has clashed harshly with Mr. Obama over foreign policy issues such as Iran and the thaw with Cuba.Mr. Menendez pointedly took issue with the president’s characterization of opponents of the deal as the same lawmakers who wrongly supported the war in Iraq, “I opposed it, unlike the vice president and the secretary of state, who both supported it.”That reference was, of course, to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Secretary of State John Kerry, who both initially backed the Iraq war.Mr. Menendez also disputed the president’s claim that the alternative to the agreement was conflict with Iran, and he urged the president to reopen the talks. The question now for the administration is not how Mr. Menendez will vote, but how much he will influence the votes of other Democrats.— Carl HulseMr. Trump has put Republicans in a difficult position by taking such a hard line on immigration.Hillary Rodham Clinton broke ranks with Mr. Obama on the subject of drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic Ocean.Text messaging — an old thing — is proving to be the next big thing in campaign politics this election cycle.In a call with donors, Mr. Walker acknowledged criticisms that he lacked passion in the first debate and said that he would spend more time taking on Washington to counter the rise of outsider candidates like Mr. Trump.Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told The Des Moines Register that there was nothing “behind the curtain” when it came to Mr. Trump, and he predicted the billionaire’s political downfall.Slate looks at the Black Lives Matter movement’s focus on Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and asks: “If Sanders is the most racially progressive candidate in the race,” as his team and supporters say he is, “then why is he a target for Black Lives Matter activists, even after he addressed core concerns over police violence and criminal justice reform?”Philip Bump at The Washington Post argues that ending birthright citizenship, as Mr. Trump said he would do and as Mr. Walker suggested he wanted to do, would be “nearly impossible.”Eli Stokols of Politico details Mr. Rubio‘s slow and steady approach in Iowa.After her strong performance at the “kiddie table” debate this month, Ms. Fiorina is polling strongly enough to possibly earn a spot on the main debate stage next month, knocking off Mr. Christie, at least according to the latest surveys, Politico reports.Mr. Rubio may have found a way to steal some of the attention that has been lavished on Mr. Trump in recent weeks: hit a child in the face with a football.Mr. Rubio’s throw was the talk of Twitter on Tuesday after a video emerged of him tossing spiral to a young Iowan this week. The boy overran the pass, and the ball collided with his nose.The dropped ball unleashed a flurry of commentary about Mr. Rubio’s throwing form, and even some suggestions that he send a Hail Mary pass in Mrs. Clinton’s direction.The child recovered from the incident, and the Rubio campaign, always happy to make lemonade from a lemon, managed to squeeze a fund-raising opportunity out of it.

"PhotoGood Tuesday morning. Politics can be tough on friendships, as Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey is seeking to put a home-state senator in a tough spot, while President Obama might find himself in a similarly awkward position if his vice president decides to challenge his former secretary of state in a bid to replace him. And to the surprise of some in her party, Hillary Rodham Clinton is proposing joint fund-raising agreements that typically occur after the nomination has been won.Mrs. Clinton‘s campaign is moving to sign fund-raising agreements with a string of state Democratic parties, and already has takers in four states, including New Hampshire.The maneuver is open to any of the Democratic candidates, but only Mrs. Clinton’s campaign is trying it.Officials with some of the state parties, asked to consider joint agreements while the nomination battle is still playing out, privately expressed confusion when they first received packets proposing legal language to create the deals.The chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic Party defended the arrangement with the Clinton campaign, suggesting he had invited all the candidates to enter such deals. But the others are deeply focused on winning the nomination in a fight against a well-funded front-runner.The “victory funds” risk adding to the perception that Mrs. Clinton, who is batting away persistent questions about her use of a private email server at the State Department, is ensconced in a shaky sense of her inevitability as the nominee.The timing also aligns with Vice President Joseph R.

He will hold a conference call with pastors and religious leaders from across the country to discuss Planned Parenthood and the recent videos that accuse it of selling fetal tissue for a profit, a charge the organization denies.Mr. Christie is staying in his home state on Tuesday, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t campaigning.He will hold a news conference at Rutgers University, a half-hour drive from his campaign headquarters in Morristown, to “encourage the New Jersey congressional delegation, particularly Senator Cory Booker, to oppose the Iran deal,” according to the event’s billing.Mr. Booker, a Democrat, continually refers to Mr. Christie as his friend, saying as recently as last month that people should not “underestimate” Mr. Christie and that he was “one of the most talented political people out there.”But his friend has put a focus on him while he struggles to thread a political needle on the Iran deal: He relies on a network of Jewish donors in New Jersey who would most likely oppose the deal, but he is also close with Mr. Obama, who is pressing Democrats hard for support. Coming out against it would fracture his relationship with the White House, which dates to the 2008 campaign.Mr. Christie’s public call on Mr. Booker could force him to take a stand, something he seems reluctant to do at the moment. But it will also generate earned media for Mr. Christie, who is battling to maintain his position in the top 10 candidates for the next Republican debate in September.Either outcome, a bipartisan ally or a public spat, keeps him in the headlines.— Nick CorasanitiLess than 24 hours after Mr. Obama returned from his summer vacation, his press secretary was peppered with questions about Mr. Biden, Mrs. Clinton and the awkward political triangle that might be just around the corner.It’s going to be that kind of September.Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden sat down on Monday for their weekly lunch together as Mr. Biden considers a challenge to Mrs. Clinton in the Democratic nominating contest. It was private, but Josh Earnest, the president’s press secretary, offered some hints.Such discussions usually “cover everything from work to family,” he said, “And I’ll leave it to you to decide whether or not you think that this decision facing the vice president falls in either of those two categories.”Mr. Earnest declined to rule out the possibility that Mr. Obama might eventually endorse a Democratic candidate. But he also demonstrated how awkward the next few weeks will be.Mr. Earnest noted that Mr. Obama had previously said that picking Mr. Biden “was the smartest decision that he had ever made in politics.” Jon Karl of ABC pounced, noting that must mean it was a better decision than picking Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state.“Yeah, it was. It was,” Mr. Earnest said, before quickly praising Mrs. Clinton. The Republican National Committee release that quickly followed left out the nice words about the former secretary of state. “Ouch!” it said.— Michael D. ShearGov. John R. Kasich of Ohio is trying to balance two competing narratives: his working-class past and the nearly eight years he spent as an investment banker with Lehman Brothers.As American markets tumbled, Republican candidates took aim at China: Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin called on Mr. Obama to cancel a state visit by the Chinese leader, and Mr. Trump warned that Beijing would “bring us down.”And Jeb Bush, whose campaign is seeking ways to curb spending, is beginning to punch back, hard, against attacks from Mr. Trump.An initiative while Mr. Bush was governor of Florida to spend $500 million enticing Scripps Research Institute to expand in the state, depended, The Los Angeles Times reports, “on the type of generous government subsidy that many conservatives now frown upon” and “failed to deliver the blockbuster biotech cluster Bush promised.”Mr. Trump‘s campaign, The New Yorker suggests, has tapped into a “confederacy of the frustrated — less a constituency than a loose alliance of Americans who say they are betrayed by politicians, victimized by a changing world, and enticed by Trump’s insurgency.”Central to Mr. Biden‘s deliberations of whether to run for president are the considerations of his family so shortly after the death of his son Beau, The Washington Post reports.The Boston Globe calls it the new poll tax: the fact that many coming presidential debates will not be aired on free television, but only on cable.",politics
"“Frankly, it’s more related to Asian people,” Jeb Bush said Monday in defense of his use of the term “anchor baby.” It had to have been one of the least artful clarifications of the 2016 presidential campaign.The term, when used by Donald Trump, among others, refers to any American child of an unauthorized immigrant, even an immigrant who has been present in the country for many years. But Mr. Bush used it to talk about the much narrower phenomenon of birth tourism: when foreign nationals travel here temporarily to give birth to children, without any immediate intention of taking up residence.Both candidates have come under criticism because of the term’s dehumanizing implication of instrumentality, in either sense of its use: that immigrants have babies to serve as “anchors” that ward off deportation and make it easier to get citizenship for themselves in the future, unlike Americans, who have babies for all the normal reasons.“It offends a lot of people,” Marco Rubio said. “I don’t use the term.”“They’re called babies,” Hillary Clinton said on Twitter.",politics

"Pittsburgh — AMERICAN children have been bad at math for well over a century now. As early as 1895, educational reformers lamented Americans’ “meager results” in the subject. Over the years, critics of math education in this country have cycled through a set of familiar culprits, blaming inadequate teacher training, lackluster student motivation and faulty curricular design. Today’s debates over the Common Core mathematical standards are just the latest iteration of this dispute.Although these issues are important — no reform can ever succeed without considering teacher training and textbook design — resolving them will never make the underlying question of how to teach math “go away.” This is because debates about learning mathematics are debates about how educated citizens should think generally. Whether it is taught as a collection of facts, as a set of problem-solving heuristics or as a model of logical deduction, learning math counts as learning to reason. That is, in effect, a political matter, and therefore inherently contestable. Reasonable people can and will disagree about it.Perhaps no reform has illustrated this point as clearly as the wide range of mid-20th-century curricular changes known as the new math. Many of these reforms promised that the introduction of sets, nondecimal bases and formal definitions would lead students to think of math as more than just a bunch of dusty facts: It was a powerful and rigorous way of approaching complex problems.The new math was widely praised at first as a model bipartisan reform effort. It was developed in the 1950s as part of the “Cold War of the classrooms,” and the resulting textbooks were most widely disseminated in the 1960s, with liberals and academic elites promoting it as a central component of education for the modern world. The United States Chamber of Commerce and political conservatives also praised federal support of curriculum reforms like the new math, in part because these reforms were led by mathematicians, not so-called progressive educators.",politics
"I CAME to Jane Austen’s “Emma” in my 50s, which is late for many Austen aficionados. The story of a wealthy 21-year-old woman who lives with her father and imagines herself a matchmaker hadn’t caught my attention until then. At first, I was made uneasy by Emma as she imagines romance where it isn’t and misses it where it is. But during a caregiving crisis in my life, I lost count of how many times I read or listened to Austen’s novel. I turned her words over in my mind like a piece of slowly melting hard candy.Early on in tending to my mother, who had Alzheimer’s, I was sustained by other Austen novels, but during the middle stages of her disease it was all “Emma,” all the time. What started as entertainment soon became an important guide.It seemed that I was always one step behind her illness, so I stockpiled books on caregiving, including Kenneth P. Scileppi’s “Caring for the Parents Who Cared for You.” When I read his statement “In the life of a demented individual, there is one cardinal rule: All change is for the worse,” the person I thought of wasn’t my cognitively impaired 92-year-old mother; it was Emma’s father, Mr. Woodhouse. He is introduced to us as “a nervous man” who hated “change of every kind.”The novel asserts that Emma had little to distress or vex her, yet describes many distressing and vexing events. Emma is parenting her parent and has been doing so for quite some time.",politics

"After the facts are gathered, we put them through the next step, analysis. Here the job can become more art than science. We look for patterns (voted to raise taxes 30 times), for anomalies (voted against military spending except one time, cui bono?) and for oddities.Once, for a candidate in a primary congressional race, I scoured every piece of publicly available information on the opponent — that meant dozens of hours rummaging through newspaper databases, votes, the Internet and video, digital and courthouse records.Oddly, the opponent paid only a fraction of his estimated property taxes. Turned out he was claiming an agricultural exemption on his land. Considering that the candidate was a lawyer, not a rancher, this made little sense.I figured out that he was leasing his land to a farmer, growing a few crops, and then claiming a tax break meant to help family farms.He said, in his defense, “I broke no laws.” That phrase was among the sweetest sounds I’ve ever heard in my career as a researcher. In fact, he had not broken any law, but voters were not so understanding of his scheme. On Election Day he was soundly defeated.Dissemination is the third step. A campaign must decide how and when to use this material. Should we put it in ads or make it public in speeches? Do we rush it out early or hold it for rapid response? It often helps to have good relations with the news media for this purpose. In 2003, Representative Steve LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, gained notice for divorcing his wife over the phone and taking up with his former chief of staff. In research, I found out that his former chief of staff had become a lobbyist, with clients who were benefiting from Mr. LaTourette’s membership on a transportation committee.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

One Capitol Hill paper actually asked me to produce a picture of Mr. LaTourette and his paramour together in order to run the story.Instead, I found a freelance writer with an interest in honest government, not just salacious details. He pitched a story based on ethics to Salon. The story ran, and newspapers followed up, including the ones that wanted the sex angle covered.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAnother main misperception about my occupation is in the very name, “opposition research.” It’s not always opposition research; campaigns perform as much research on their own candidate as they do on the opposition. In fact, defensive projects take longer and are harder to execute than opposition research.For Mr. Schumer, I read over 21,000 articles and sifted through over 9,000 votes. For a different election, in 2002, I was working for the underdog congressional campaign of Timothy H. Bishop in New York. While doing what we call the defensive, we found an article that accused Mr. Bishop, a former provost of Southampton College, of altering rape statistics on campus. However, in following up, we discovered that the article was based on discredited information.We were faced with a dissemination question. Rather than releasing that information early to inoculate our candidate, the campaign decided to hold it. When our opponent, Felix J. Grucci Jr., ran a radio ad based on the article, the Bishop campaign unleashed its rebuttal. The campaign provided statistics and background sources to the press, proving that the article was false.Mr. Grucci’s attack strategy was quickly discredited, and it brought more attention to the race. A former campaign staffer for Mr. Grucci later said “it was definitely the difference maker in that race,” which Mr. Bishop won by a slim margin of one percentage point.The simple truth is, good campaigns value research. The rest suffer the consequences. Recent events on the presidential campaign trail highlight this point.Senator Marco Rubio’s campaign has flashed some impressive research skills, especially on the immigration issue. When Senator Ted Cruz of Texas went after Mr. Rubio for his past work on a bipartisan immigration bill that included a pathway to citizenship, or what Republicans call amnesty, the Rubio campaign countered swiftly with votes and quotes made by Mr. Cruz that appeared to show him supporting a pathway to citizenship. With prepared research, Mr. Rubio’s team was able to blunt Mr. Cruz’s attack.The campaign of Mr. Carson illustrated the dangers of improperly performing self-research. Confirming the biography of your candidate is one of the most basic tasks in the profession, yet his campaign was wildly unprepared for questions in this area. Mr. Carson couldn’t deliver his message to voters for days, even weeks, because, incredibly, he was stuck defending his account of a long-ago stabbing incident involving a friend, or “close relative,” foiled by a belt buckle.Ultimately, campaigns are about the candidates and their message, and good opposition research makes their success possible.",politics
"Two young campers were sleeping in Yosemite Valley this August when a tree branch snapped and fell on their tent, killing them both. “We don’t know what caused the limb to fall,” said the park’s spokeswoman, Jodi Bailey. “It seems like just a freak accident.”Ms. Bailey was right: Being killed by a falling object is extremely rare. On average, about 680 Americans each year die this way, or about two people per million. The accident was seen as so unusual that it became national news, covered by CNN, The Los Angeles Times, MSN and The Daily Beast.Yet in other developed countries, there is another cause of death that is just as rare: homicide by gun.In Germany, for example, about two out of every million people are fatally shot by another person each year — making such events as uncommon there as the campers’ deaths in Yosemite. Gun homicides are just as rare in several other European countries, including the Netherlands and Austria. In the United States, two per million is roughly the death rate for hypothermia or plane crashes.",politics
"Gone are most of the Cuban boticas, where the pharmacists eagerly doled out prescription-free antibiotics to Cuban customers. Gone, too, are the long trail of Cuban restaurants, like Casablanca and Ayestarán, that snaked up or just off Eighth and Flagler Streets, where we gorged on boniato (a Cuban sweet potato) and tasajo (beef stewed with citrus). A few barber shops remain, but none have the charm of Nenito and the Cuban special: a shave and a robust anti-Castro tirade.They’ve been replaced by Nicaraguan and Honduran restaurants offering heaping portions of fritangas and baleadas, shoehorned between pawn shops and check cashing joints. More than half the neighborhood’s residents are now Central and South Americans.In many ways, it’s tougher for them. Those who fled the strife of revolution, civil war and the drug war in Central America were not all welcomed and granted legal status, as is the case for Cuban immigrants who reach American shores.

Greeks lived here, too, which is why a Greek Orthodox cathedral sits nearby. History dictates that one group of immigrants replaces the next; I get it. But for me this transition is filled with melancholy. Memories fade, then disappear.Calle OchoOr they are recast and mingled with the new.At the hub of Calle Ocho, around 10th Avenue, a refreshing kind of second-generation Cuban cool has settled. I step inside the popular Azucar ice cream parlor, where the owner, Suzy Battle, has fused her grandmother’s homemade ice cream recipes with Cuban flavors, like guava, and galleticas Maria, which she lovingly calls Abuela Maria after her grandmother, and which I lovingly savor.The owner of the 1930s building that houses Azucar is another grandchild of Cuban exiles, Bill Fuller. He and his partners are scooping up properties. They are hoping to buff up and preserve the kind of low-scale architecture that commands you to slow down and linger — the buildings with porches, stoops and charm. But, like Ms. Battle, he is trying to fuse the past with the present, and has plans for a hotel, restaurants and art galleries (some exist already).Advertisement Continue reading the main storyIn the evenings, people pour into Ball and Chain, a 1930s-era jazz club. Chet Baker played there. So did Billie Holiday and Count Basie, until the Count shut down the place in 1957 with a lawsuit accusing the owner of stiffing him. Now, the club looking as it did then, a Miami crowd — not necessarily locals or tourists — sips “pastelito daiquiris” and listens to live Latin music. By day, the club’s drummers sit on the sidewalk slapping their congas.The block’s anchor is the graceful Art Deco Tower Theater, where my brother and his friends escaped the heat watching Saturday morning cartoons and learning English from James Bond and John Wayne. Now run by Miami-Dade College, it’s where my friends and I go for the latest French, Cuban or German films — another sign of both our evolving tastes and the neighborhood’s own changes.But these experiences are rare. Most of Little Havana (not unlike Havana itself) is still caught between kitsch and decay, and those trying to redefine the neighborhood must wrestle with both.Tourists come in droves now, drawn to the cigars, rum, music and guayaberas. They step off the double-decker bus and wander into the new tourist center. They watch the old men playing dominoes, like Rene Janeiro, 92, a legendary Little League coach who also made a few attempts by boat to overthrow Fidel Castro.This fishbowl version of Little Havana never seemed plausible to the locals who grew up here. “Before you didn’t, quote, go to Little Havana — nobody did,” said Mr. Encenat, who lived not far from Flagler Street and attended local schools. “You just stopped by for some congri” — rice and beans.",politics
"A number of analysts were stunned at the audacity of some of the officials, who made arrangements for bribes at meetings in the United States and, in some cases, even after the latest scandal first broke in May, despite worry about investigators.“Nothing should be said over the telephone. Nothing! ... Nothing! Nothing!” the indictment quotes Brayan Jiménez, the president of the Guatemala soccer federation, as saying at a meeting in Chicago in July to negotiate an alleged bribe payment.The indictment sent shock waves through soccer heavyweights like Brazil and Argentina as well as smaller countries like Guatemala and Costa Rica. Mr. Callejas, the president of Honduras from 1990 to 1994 and the president of the Honduran football federation for 13 years until this past August, was quick to defend Alfredo Hawit, the current head of the Honduras federation and Concacaf president, after his arrest in Zurich, and early in the day Mr. Callejas seemed unaware that the investigation was closing in on him, too.Later, when prosecutors announced that Mr. Callejas had been charged, he appeared ashen-faced as he addressed local reporters. “I wasn’t expecting this,” he said, admitting it was “a complex, difficult situation.”Mr. Callejas said he was innocent and added, “I did not take one single dollar or lempira from” the Honduran football federation.In May, shortly after the first arrests and newly installed as the president of Concacaf, Mr. Hawit declared his innocence to the Honduran newspaper Diez and denied he was under investigation.Mr. Hawit was named president of Concacaf in May to replace Jeffrey Webb, who was arrested when the scandal broke in May. Mr. Hawit had spent many years as the secretary of the Honduran federation and then took it over from Mr. Callejas on Aug. 1. He was on the law faculty of the National Autonomous University of Honduras, the country’s main university.",politics
"Operating in a more solitary mode, the Chinese artist Zhang Dali has for decades played the role of urban ghost in Beijing, tagging and photographing countless old buildings as they come under the wrecking ball. Before, during and after the 2011 revolution in Egypt, the young graffiti artist who calls himself Ganzeer covered the walls of Cairo with pro-democracy texts and images until, subject to intense political heat, he had to leave the country.He’s well represented in the show, with a floor-to-ceiling wall of his black-and-white graphics — as is Dyke Action Machine! (Carrie Moyer and Sue Schaffner), which gets comparable space for its wheat-paste posters. But almost no one else is. From the small and underexplained examples of work by Luis Camnitzer or Coco Fusco or Cecilia Vicuña, you can barely understand what these important figures are up to. And it’s likely that their visibility will be further diminished in the months ahead as more artists arrive and space grows scarcer.On the other hand, maybe strategic crowding, with art and artists rubbing shoulders, is what’s needed to generate the heat the exhibition now lacks. That, I think, was the plan. The museum would set the show up, make the initial choices, and then let go. After that, artists, with younger ones coming in toward the end, would take over as curators, move things around, break through the inevitably constricting politics of the institutional model.It’s a nice idea, and probably naïve, as even the mildest idealism tends to feel these days when the art world at large just wants to have fun, and the market can neutralize all.Yet there are wild cards still in the deck. Some of the collectives scheduled to join the show — Not an Alternative, Occupy Museums — are as much doers as makers, equally into actions and objects. (Both groups were involved in protests at the Louvre during the United Nations Climate Summit in Paris in the month.) Hopefully, with their appearance, the show will improve, loosen up, get voices going, generate action. But why wait? Opening the show to change could start now. That’s agitprop’s very purpose.",politics
"As I’ve discussed in the past, mammography screening for women 50 to 74 years earned a “B” recommendation, as there is a moderate net benefit to its universal biennial use. However, a “C” recommendation for those younger than 50 indicates that women and their doctors should make the decision after weighing the personal risks and benefits.The “D” given to screening for prostate cancer with a P.S.A. test for prostate cancer argues that the use of this test most likely does more harm than good. The task force’s review concluded that P.S.A. screening does not result in a decrease in mortality when used broadly, and that the extra treatment screening induces has caused significant problems, including the occasional death.This type of recommendation has consequences. The use of P.S.A. screening in men has fallen. A recent study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association showed that in 2010, before the government task force’s “D” announcement, about 35 percent of men between 50 and 74 were screened versus just over 30 percent in 2013.Another study in the same journal examined the incidence of prostate cancer and the stage of cancer being diagnosed before and after the latest recommendations. In 2008, about 541 cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed per 100,000 men. In 2012, that number had dropped to 416. From just 2011 to 2012, the researchers estimated that roughly 33,000 fewer cases of prostate cancer had been diagnosed nationwide.Is that good or bad? It’s hard to say. Certainly, some of those nondiagnoses will never cause problems and not lead to death. But some might. In an accompanying editorial, Dr. David Penson, chairman of urology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, argued that better strategies might be needed. Perhaps we could screen less often, or target those at highest risk. We might even raise the P.S.A. threshold of suspicion, so that fewer nonthreatening cases of cancer are acted upon.The recommendations on mammograms, while less restrictive, have caused even more controversy. However, they haven’t really gone into effect. In 2009, when the task force issued the “C” rating for women younger than 50, many people were upset. Amendments to the Affordable Care Act specifically mandated that the A.C.A. would consider the 2002 report’s “B” rating, and not the 2009 report’s “C,” when making coverage decisions.In other words, Obamacare specifically ignored the 2009 recommendation, and has continued to do so, until the next set of recommendations comes in. That’s happening now, and once again, it’s leading to controversy. Bills have been submitted in both the House and the Senate to continue to override the task force. Another bill would radically change how the task force works and functions.",politics
"In response, they are taking action. They are abortion-clinic escorts, they are reforming campus policies on assault and for transgender students, they are leading the Black Lives Matter movement. Young women are neither ungrateful to their feminist foremothers nor complacent; rather, they are activists for feminist causes that reflect their needs.Teresa Younger, the president and chief executive of the Ms. Foundation for Women, says that young women now grow up in an environment that values their futures — certainly more than they have in the past — and this means they have “different lived experiences” than feminists of Mrs. Clinton’s generation, which can mean different priorities in voting.These experience include being in university environments where there are more female than male students, and coming from high schools where girls outperform the boys. Equal treatment of women and men on college campuses remains regulated, albeit imperfectly, by Title IX. Women attend graduate schools in roughly equal or greater numbers than men. College-educated women see only a tiny pay gap in their early- and mid-20s, making 97 cents for every dollar earned by their male colleagues.That experience starts to change a few more years into the work force. By 35, those same college-educated women are making 15 percent less than their male peers. Women’s earnings peak between ages 35 and 44 and then plateau, while men’s continue to rise.What starts out as a near 50-50 professional split among new lawyers, for example, becomes a big gap: Women are just 17 percent of equity partners at law firms generally, according to the National Association of Women Lawyers.When women have children, they’re penalized: They’re considered less competent, they’re less likely to be hired for a new job and they’re paid less. For men, having a child helps in hiring and pay. For many families, it starts to “just make sense” for the husband to take on the role of primary breadwinner while the wife drops out of the labor force, compromising future earnings when she tries to go back to work.“You realize how many women are left standing as you age, and what happens to your brilliant and talented friends and colleagues from your 20s and 30s,” said Heather Boushey, the executive director and chief economist for the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, who has provided advice to the Clinton campaign. “These are tough lessons, and ones that you may not think are as pressing until you actually see them happen to your own friends and cohorts.”Advertisement Continue reading the main storyEven for women active in feminist causes in college, as I was a dozen years ago, that can be a rude awakening. As a young lawyer, one of the first things I noticed about department meetings at my law firm was not just the dearth of female partners, but that one of the few female partners always seemed to be in charge of ordering lunch. I listened as some of my male colleagues opined on the need to marry a woman who would stay home with the children — that wasn’t sexist, they insisted, because it wasn’t that they thought only women should stay home; it was just that somebody had to, and the years in which they planned on having children would be crucial ones for their own careers.I saw that the older white, male partners who mentored the younger white, male associates were able to work long days and excel professionally precisely because their stay-at-home wives took care of everything else; I saw that virtually none of the female partners had a similar setup.In jobs that followed, managers would remark that they wanted “more women” and proceed to reject qualified candidates. (Similar dynamics took place with minority candidates.) There were always reasons — not the right cultural fit, not the right experience, a phenomenon of unintentional sexism now well documented in controlled studies. I watched as men with little or irrelevant experience were hired and promoted, because they had such great ideas, or they fit in better. “We want a woman,” the conclusion seemed to be, “just not this woman.”Watching a primary election in which an eminently qualified woman long assumed to be a shoo-in for the Democratic nomination faces a serious challenge from an older white guy with exciting ideas, many women my age and older hear something familiar, and personal, in the now-common refrain about Hillary Clinton: “I want a woman president, just not this woman president.”“A lot of the women I was friends with in college would have never called themselves feminists, but now that we’ve been in the workplace for 10 years, a lot has changed and they’re becoming more radical,” said Aminatou Sow, a digital strategist and a founder of a support network for women in technology called Tech LadyMafia. They realize, she said, “that the work world and the world at large remains a place that’s built by men and for men.”That’s part of what makes Mrs. Clinton’s candidacy so compelling for Ms. Sow. “I pray to God that one day we can field a female Bernie Sanders candidate, some disheveled lady yelling, and the country will seriously consider her,” she said. “But nothing in our culture indicates to me that that’s remotely possible right now.”It is possible that it will change, and that a 19-year-old aspiring lawyer who is volunteering for Mr. Sanders today will work for firms with more female partners and live in a world where the wage gap has shrunk. But the trends show that her experience in a decade is unlikely to be that different from mine.While the contours of sexism shift with age, the number of usable hours in each day shrinks. Many more women over 25 are in the work force than those under, and women over 25 also do about twice as much unpaid domestic work as their younger counterparts.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyFor the many women who live at the center of that time crush, Mrs. Clinton’s emphasis on the wage gap, paid family leave and universal prekindergarten may be particularly appealing. Mr. Sanders, who also supports paid leave and universal pre-K, takes a different rhetorical tone, usually stressing affordable higher education and universal health care.“It’s great to talk about free college, but if you wanted to do something that would help a lot of families, address the really important issue of care in the zero-to-5 years,” Ms. Boushey, the economist, said. “Child care is just as expensive in many places as sending a kid to public university, but a college kid can get a part-time job. A toddler can’t.”There are many other reasons women in the 30-and-over cohort may lean toward Mrs. Clinton. They’ve already seen promises of revolutionary change fall short. They may prefer a candidate with a progressive ideology but a more restrained, and potentially more effective, strategy for putting that ideology in place.They also want to see a woman in the Oval Office. If it’s not this woman, this year, then who and when?At 32, I’m right at the sweet spot between “older millennial” and “uninteresting adult” — enough years on the planet to qualify as a grown-up, but still no house, no mortgage, no marriage, no children, but a job I like, a law degree, and the large pile of student loan debt that comes with it.Most of that is the result of specifically feminist achievements unthinkable a century ago: an open door to college and law school; a bank account and credit card in my own name; easy access to birth control, which not only made it possible to delay marriage and childbearing but also made it mostly unremarkable to be an unmarried, childless 32 year old; a culture in which women are expected to have identities outside of “wife and mother.” Even my own resentment at the sexism I’ve experienced can be articulated, described with specific terms, because of decades of feminist activism.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

"WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats were slightly surprised when Republicans told the White House budget director this month not to bother making the ritual presentation of a spending plan.

"STUART GOTTLIEBNew YorkThe writer teaches public policy at Columbia University.We live in the midst of difficult times, and pessimism about our institutions seems natural. But generations far less educated than the present one elected Lincoln, the two Roosevelts and other highly qualified presidents. We descend from people who won a revolution against great odds, survived a brutal civil war, defied an oligarchy to free millions of slaves, and helped to save the world from the twin threats of Nazism and Communism.Those generations also harbored skeptics who doubted the intelligence and capacity of their fellow citizens. Their views did not prevail, however, and neither should those of our own Cassandras.JAMES H. LEEArlington, Tex.Professor Millies laments that reason is no longer enough to win in American politics. But it never has been. Candidates have shamelessly played on people’s fears for as far back as I can recall. Remember the Lyndon B. Johnson 1964 campaign ad “Daisy,” showing an innocent little girl, and then an atomic bomb blast? Remember George H. W. Bush’s 1988 ad about Willie Horton, who committed crimes while on furlough?The whole campaign process is profoundly irrational, and emotion and symbolism are crucial to it. Edmund Muskie may have lost the race for the 1972 Democratic nomination because he wept in public. Michael Dukakis lost the 1988 presidential race partly because he looked silly riding around in a tank. In short, while a good summary of this year is “God help us,” that pretty much sums up every election year.MARGARET F. NICHOLSIthaca, N.Y.The apparent decline in the effectiveness of evidence and reason in American politics is a direct result of the rise in political participation by evangelical Christians. Their adherence to uncompromising sectarian dogma is clearly the origin of their opposition to L.G.B.T. rights, abortion and the scientific fact of global warming. Their influence is evidenced by the inability of Republicans to compromise, leading to the current gridlock in Washington.DON SHIPPHomestead, Fla.Mr. Millies dismisses the anxieties of working-class and uneducated white voters as irrational. Whether or not this is accurate, it is important to recognize that the rhetoric of the far left has done a great deal to fuel the perception among white voters and men that their perspectives are unwelcome in our political discourse. Those who oppose affirmative action are presumed to be bigots who want to prevent women and minorities from advancing socially and economically. Those who propose that men accused of rape on college campuses should be presumed innocent until proven guilty are accused of apologizing for rapists.One of the great challenges of 21st-century politics will be to continue the progress that has been made for women and minorities without leaving others feeling that they are being left behind. So far, neither party has risen to it. The Democrats would be perfect to take this on, as many of their economic proposals would advance the interests of Americans of all races and genders. Yet as long as they cling to the rhetoric of privilege checking and safe spaces and refuse to hear the voices of all Americans, many will continue to feel alienated by the party and vote against their own economic self-interest.",politics

Nixon offered a plane to take the Humphreys home, saying they should leave with some dignity, not standing in line to check luggage.When the Humphreys got aboard, there was a bouquet with a card that said “With best wishes, Pat and Dick.”In 1978, less than a week before he died, Humphrey called Nixon, self-isolated in California.

"The debate over widening inequality, and what to do about it, has gradually moved toward the center of the political agenda and fueled populist movements on the left and the right in many nations.But in the United States — where a competitive political campaign requires huge sums of money, and wealth or access to it is increasingly a prerequisite for entry — the debate has become supercharged.Voters in both parties find themselves wondering whether anyone is looking out for the little guy, even as a candidate like Donald J. Trump suggests that it is precisely his wealth that liberates him from the influence of special interests.So it is fair to ask whether a politician’s personal bankroll should be taken into account by voters as a predictor of how he or she might lead. A growing body of research has addressed the extent to which wealth, behavior and policy are linked.",politics
"“We don’t have to make choices anymore,” Mr. Feist said, about where to go or whom to cover.The scoops have rolled in. When a Black Lives Matter protester was roughed up at a Trump rally in November, Jeremy Diamond, who covers Mr. Trump for the CNN website, was the only reporter to capture the incident on video. Maeve Reston and Scott Glover, both former Los Angeles Times reporters, were the first to call into question key elements of Ben Carson’s autobiography, in a story that broke first on the CNNPolitics website before going on to drive the television news cycle.“I’ve worked at a bunch of places, and I’ve never been at a place that felt more central to the coverage of the presidential races,” said Jake Tapper, a newcomer to the CNN political team since the past cycle, who will be moderating the Republican debate on March 10 in Miami on CNN. “And this comes at a time when other broadcast news organizations are actually in many cases lessening or pulling back their coverage on politics.”Not all of the reviews have been raves. Critics, competing candidates, and rivals in the news media have suggested CNN is “obsessed” with Mr. Trump, as Joe Scarborough of MSNBC put it last fall, pointing to CNN’s seemingly insatiable appetite for interviews with Mr. Trump (often on the phone), coverage of and discussion of his campaign. Some CNN employees reportedly complained — as did Charles Barkley, the former N.B.A. star who is a commentator on Turner Sports, a corporate cousin.In an interview, Mr. Zucker gave a pat explanation: Mr. Trump is more likely to say “yes” to his bookers.“You can say what you want, but Donald Trump has been willing to subject himself to interviews,” Mr. Zucker said. “And just because he’s willing to do it and others weren’t necessarily willing to do it, doesn’t mean that he should be penalized because the others won’t do it. And we shouldn’t be penalized for not doing it because the others won’t do it.” He added, in a jab at the harder-to-get Senator Marco Rubio of Florida: “The phone lines work from Miami, too.”The Trump focus aside, CNN’s investment in personnel for its digital side has begun to change the organization from the inside out. The network is hiring writers and reporters with no prior television experience, and Mr. Zucker said he counted Politico, Huffington Post and The New York Times as competitors as much as Fox News, MSNBC or CBS.",politics
"First, they are unimpressed by the Republican candidates for president, and are even afraid of some. That means that our discussions can be narrowly focused on the Democratic race.They like Bernie Sanders and don’t fully trust Hillary Clinton, though they don’t believe Sanders is electable and would therefore “settle for” Clinton in that case, as my youngest son put it.They view Sanders as the more “authentic” (that word kept coming up) and consistent of the two, and the one with whom they have the most ideological agreement, even though they generally believed that his positions would most likely be impossible to implement.My children went to high school in the city that gave birth to Occupy Wall Street, and as such we had many an evening discussion about income inequality at the dinner table. In a way, Bernie Sanders is the first Occupy Wall Street presidential candidate. There is little daylight between their positions.All of my children, including my sons, describe themselves as feminists. Indeed, I once wrote about my oldest son’s firm belief that “it’s very important for everyone to be a feminist.”And yet, none of them, including my daughter, was moved by the fact that, if elected, Clinton would be this country’s first female president.The particular phenomenon of young women expressing no fealty for Clinton on the basis of gender is a head scratcher for many older Americans, particularly pioneering feminists, who have been part of the struggle to bring women’s rights as far as they’ve come.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyKate Cronin-Furman and Mira Rapp-Hooper point out in an article on Vox that this is understandable for young women who exist in educational environments where they regularly equal or even outperform young men.But they caution that these young women, upon entering the work force, are likely to encounter what they call “late-breaking sexism,” defined as “the sudden realization that you don’t have the same opportunities as a man, that you will struggle to have both a family and a career, that your participation in the public sphere will always be caveated by your gender.”My children were 7 and 4 on 9/11. That day, after working late into the night trying to make sense of the trauma and the tragedy, I finally made it home. They were asleep, but I woke them. I told them what they already knew, that some bad men had done a bad thing, but I reassured them that they were safe and would remain so.From that year to this one, America has been at war. Indeed, if you are under 30, this country has been at war for half or more of your life. Therefore, the most noninterventionist, least hawkish candidates probably hold more appeal than the others, even with the current threat of the Islamic State.My children can’t remember a time when terrorism wasn’t a threat. They have lived most of their lives with the ambient possibility of calamity. In the same way that I grew up with — and am numb to — the possibility of global thermonuclear war, so they are with the threat of terror.The one area where they struggled with both candidates was on the issue of racial and social justice.The 1990s, when they were born, saw the incredible rise of multiculturalism and political correctness as a concept. But those concepts didn’t strike at the root of systemic racism and the white supremacy that begot it, but rather provided more palatable ways to address difference. Nowhere was this more evident than in pop culture. For instance, hip-hop crossed over, and most of the Disney princesses introduced that decade were not white: Jasmine was Middle Eastern, Pocahontas was Native American and Mulan was Chinese. (As a dad with a daughter, I got my fill of Disney princesses.)But there has been an abrupt racial awaking for my children and a historical reclamation of memory as they have begun to wrestle with the persistence and perniciousness of racism and have come to identify with the goals of Black Lives Matter.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyThey see the new proposals by both candidates as pandering to black votes, although they each mentioned that Sanders had been active in the civil rights movement. My eldest son said that he was disappointed about Clinton’s involvement with the 1994 crime bill and mass incarceration. He was born in 1994.I must say that I have no memory of the bill’s passage. I was a young man with a young family who had just moved from the Deep South to Detroit.It is possible that the bill’s passage isn’t marked by a memory for me because so many liberals were behind the bill: Joe Biden took credit for it, Bernie Sanders voted for it, Bill Clinton signed it and Hillary Clinton lobbied for it. Furthermore, many members of the Congressional Black Caucus voted for it. Indeed, the bill got more Democratic votes than Republican ones.I do, however, remember the Whitewater investigation from 1994, one of the first Clinton administration scandals, the one that also spawned Travelgate and Filegate. The Clintons were never prosecuted in any of those investigations, but they emerged scarred.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Sign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

The continued investigations added to my children’s mistrust of her. Maybe that’s what Republicans want; maybe some of their leeriness is warranted; maybe there is some place between smear campaign and smoking gun where reasonable people can be reasonably apprehensive.Whatever the case, she seems to me weakened by the decades of questions, which may have even more of a deleterious effect on young people’s willingness to trust her.This is hardly a broad survey, and shouldn’t be taken as such. No sweeping conclusions can be drawn from this column, nor are they meant to be.

"IN early 2009, as Barack Obama was about to take office, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican minority in the Senate, assembled his caucus at a retreat in West Virginia. There, he laid out his strategy for taking on the new president, who was sweeping into office on a tide of popularity, historical resonance and great expectations barely diminished by the economic free fall then underway.The key, Mr. McConnell told his fellow Republicans, was to stymie and undermine Mr. Obama, but to do so in subtle ways. As one of the senators present, Robert F. Bennett of Utah, later recalled to me: “Mitch said, ‘We have a new president with an approval rating in the 70 percent area. We do not take him on frontally. We find issues where we can win, and we begin to take him down, one issue at a time. We create an inventory of losses, so it’s Obama lost on this, Obama lost on that. And we wait for the time where the image has been damaged to the point where we can take him on.’ ”Seven years later, with the Republicans now in the Senate majority, the opposition led by Mr. McConnell is as frontal as can be. After word of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death emerged last weekend, it took the majority leader less than an hour to announce that the Senate would not entertain a replacement before November. “This vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,” he said.Mr. McConnell’s blunt declaration was taken as the starkest exhibition yet of the obstructionism that has characterized the Kentucky senator’s stance toward President Obama and congressional Democrats. The resistance from Mr. McConnell has had an enormous influence on the shape of Obama’s presidency. It has limited the president’s accomplishments and denied him the mantle of the postpartisan unifier he sought back in 2008. But it has also brought the Senate, the institution to which Mr. McConnell has devoted his life, close to rupture.",politics
"You have to respect American voters. They are changing the lexicon in their anger with the status quo. They don’t care about consistency. They care about energy. Reasonableness dies. Provocation works. Whether you are for or against something, or both at the same time, is secondary to the rise your position gets. Our times are unpunctuated. Politics, too, has a new language, spoken above all by the Republican front-runner as he repeats that, “There is something going on.”Yes, there is something going on. The phrase resonates with people who feel they have somehow lost control. Stuck, they seek movement above all.I am not alone in my illiteracy. All around me I see people struggling to understand, anxious they cannot keep up, outpaced by forces they cannot grasp. With knowledge of, and access to, the billions of people sharing the planet has come a new loneliness. How cold and callous is the little screen of our insidious temptation, working our fingers so hard to produce so little!That acronym, FOMO, is used by Nir Eyal, a former game designer, in his book “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products.” In it he describes the fear-of-missing-out mood that triggers people to turn and return to a successful app: “Feelings of boredom, loneliness, frustration, confusion, and indecisiveness often instigate a slight pain or irritation and prompt an almost instantaneous and often mindless action to quell the negative sensation.”I nodded my head at this in Jacob Weisberg’s review in The New York Review of Books. In the same review, Weisberg writes, “Once out of bed, we check our phones 221 times a day — an average of every 4.3 minutes — according to a U.K. study.” He also notes that one thing young people don’t do on their smartphones “is actually speak to one another.”This appears to be some form of addictive delirium. It is probably dangerous in some still unknowable way.But if this is a confession, it is not a lament. Yes, I feel illiterate. Technology has upended not only newspapers. It has upended language itself, which is none other than a community’s system of communication. What is a community today? Can there be community at all with downward gazes? I am not sure. But I am certain that cross-platform content has its beauty and its promise if only I could learn the right words to describe them.",politics
"But the hoodie did not warrant enough consideration to earn its diminutive nickname until after it was processed by B-boys, graffiti artists and break dancers in the ’80s. Youth culture did the work of tugging it from the sphere of sportswear, where clothing exists to enhance performance, into the world of street wear, where clothing is performance in itself. By the 1990 release of the video for ‘‘Mama Said Knock You Out,’’ with LL Cool J styled as a boxer in his corner, his lips visible beneath a hood that shielded his eyes, the hoodie had accomplished its transformation into an element of style.Like their peers in the suburbs, bundled up on BMX bikes or skateboarding in sweatshirts with the logo of Thrasher magazine, a generation of hip-hop kids found the hoodie suitable for the important adolescent work of taking up space and dramatizing the self. There was and is a theater of the hood: pulling it up with a flourish, tugging it down to settle in its energetic slouch. The hood frames a dirty look, obscures acne and anxiety, masks headphones in study hall, makes a cone of solitude that will suffice for an autonomous realm. And if, in its antisurveillance capacity, the hood plays with the visual rhetoric of menace, it is heir to a tradition in teen dressing stretching back to the birth of the teenager, when he arrived fully formed in leather jacket and bluejeans. The cover of the Wu-Tang Clan’s first album catches the mood: Members of the group wear black hoodies and white masks, as if to abduct the listener into a fantasy of ninja stealth.Slide ShowBut this was just a prologue to an era in which the hoodie became at once an anodyne style object and a subject of moral panic, its popularity and its selective stigmatization rising in proportion. A glance at almost any police blotter, or a recollection of the forensic sketch of the Unabomber, will confirm the hoodie as a wardrobe staple of the criminal class, and this makes it uniquely convenient as a proxy for racial profiling or any other exercise of enmity. The person itching to confirm a general bias against hip-hop kids or crusty punks imputes crooked character to the clothing itself.Which brings you to the transcript of the 911 call made by Trayvon Martin’s killer. Dispatcher: ‘‘Did you see what he was wearing?’’ George Zimmerman: ‘‘Yeah. A dark hoodie, like a gray hoodie.’’ Triv­ial details can bear serious import. Surely there would have been demonstrations after the killing and the killer’s acquittal regardless of what the victim wore. As it happened, those demonstrators — legislators on chamber floors, marchers in the street — picked up the sweatshirt as an emblem, donning hoods in solidarity. Instantly a symbol aggrieved at having to be one, the hoodie was jolted into a curious space: Where the basic hoodie means to defend against the elements, the protest hoodie seeks to offend the right people. In the paranoid view of stodgy shopkeepers, the hoodie is to be feared for extinguishing individuality; in its politicized life, it mutes identity to signal alliance, not unlike a resistance group’s uniform.All that potential subtext is attached to a generally evocative item of clothing. The white working-class hoodie still glows with the Rocky Balboa ideal of grit and tenacity. The yoga-class hoodie is sold on a promise of snuggly virtue that may explain why in Saskatchewan they call the thing a ‘‘bunny hug.’’ The tech-sector hoodie made default by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg carries on the garment’s proud juvenile tradition of informality and defiance. Once perceived as an affront to professionalism, it has since settled in as a convention.In January, there emerged a debate in the business press regarding the rituals of dress in the tech industry and their relationship to the field’s hospitableness to women. The argument proceeded in an article on Quartz headlined ‘‘The Subtle Sexism of Hoodies’’ and in counterarguments suggesting, for instance, that ‘‘hoodies represent a rejection of old ideas and an openness to new ones.’’ I was struck by the ready acceptance of the notion that a Silicon Valley hoodie was not just a prerequisite in its field, like Gucci loafers on Wall Street, but also a costume of dominance. Its visual strength abets its powers as a cultural marker, needing just a nudge to create its own contexts.You must have seen a sitcom or TV commercial in which black actors wear hoodies in new millennial colors — mustard, maroon — to portray coders. In a current General Electric ad, for example, the costume functions as characterization, and the cheery color of the cotton somehow trumps that of the skin in terms of mass iconography. But the ascent of casual wear does not quite disguise the unchanging strictness of social codes, and the hood continues to frame matters of class and race in ways that tend to satisfy the interest of power. The lingering question of the hoodie is simply: Who enjoys the right to wear one without challenge?",politics
"MEXICO CITY — IN 2011, when the Republican presidential hopeful Herman Cain proposed building an electric fence on the Mexican border, it predictably caused shock waves south of the Rio Grande. Priests, the press and a former president expressed outrage. Mr. Cain quickly pulled back, saying he was just kidding. “That is not a serious plan,” he said. “America needs to get a sense of humor. That is a joke, O.K.?”Mr. Cain’s retreat reflected a back and forth that had defined the Mexican-American relationship for decades. It was understood that, from time to time, a politician might take a potshot at Mexico. But there was a line: If the punch was too hard, the right voices here would call foul, and the politician would back down.Until Donald J. Trump. He infamously kicked off his campaign with the taunting phrase “They’re rapists.” Mexico’s foreign relations department called him out for “prejudice, racism and total ignorance,” while major Mexican companies boycotted him. But Mr. Trump only doubled down. His signature line — “We are going to build a wall. And who is going to pay for it?” — draws cheers from his supporters.Normally, Mexican TV networks only sparsely report on American primaries, but this year’s have garnered almost daily coverage. Viewers here watch with horror Mr. Trump’s leering, reddened face decrying them from Michigan to Mississippi — and the big crowds egging him on. Some here have recommended calm, arguing that the best way to deal with bullies is to ignore them. Others say that it is dangerous to be silent in the face of bigotry and incitement, especially when the fiery language translates into violence, like when Trump supporters beat a Hispanic man in Boston in August.",politics

They can either be beauties or beasts or “the love of my life.” They can be “crazy” or “losers,” “fat pigs” or “dogs.” They can be mothers and daughters. They can be the currency with which you buy voters’ belief in your machismo and alpha-maleness, or they can be the sand you kick in the face of a “New York bully.” In every case, whether they are assets or liabilities, they are objects.

When the Utah ad went public, it wasn’t long before the predictable calls to leave candidates’ families out of the fray were joined by charges of slut-shaming, and the insistence that a grown woman can pose as she wishes; that as long as it’s her choice, it’s empowering.Melania Trump might have chosen to pose for GQ, but there’s nothing empowering about the way her husband’s opponents have repurposed her modeling portfolio as revenge porn. Which is precisely what Mr. Trump has done with Megyn Kelly’s GQ shots. Neither woman deserves to suffer for having made the choice to get in front of a camera.MY guess is that neither one will. Twenty years ago — or even as recently as 2004, when the Federal Communications Commission fined CBS $550,000 after Janet Jackson’s Super Bowl halftime “wardrobe malfunction” — to be female and naked was to be afraid. But now, our biggest reality TV star is Kim Kardashian, a woman who spun a sex tape into gold, a woman who posts nude selfies, then twirls on her haters, while her fans come roaring to her defense, claiming that she has subverted the male gaze because she’s the one creating the image and she’s the one sharing the shot.When a collection of naked celebrity pictures were spirited out of the cloud, then leaked to the public in 2014, it was the hacking that shocked people, not the existence of the pictures. Not even a Disney princess like Vanessa Hudgens had her career derailed by repeated leaked nudes.The would-be first ladies will survive nudity, and mockery, but both of them have been diminished, stripped of their personhood and reduced to objects. They have been flattened into human baseball cards, to be rated and traded, compared and assessed, and their worth depends not on who they are or what they do, but on how good they look and how much their husbands love them.",politics
"When the U.S. military trains fighter pilots, it uses a concept called the OODA loop. It stands for observe, orient, decide, act. The idea is that if your ability to observe, orient, decide and act in a dogfight at 30,000 feet is faster than the other pilot’s, you’ll shoot his plane out of the sky. If the other pilot’s OODA loop is faster, he’ll shoot you out of the sky. For a while now, it’s been obvious that our national OODA loop is broken — and it couldn’t be happening at a worse time.Our OODA loop is busted right when the three largest forces on the planet — technology, globalization and climate change — are in simultaneous nonlinear acceleration. Climate change is intensifying. Technology is making everything faster and amplifying every voice. And globalization is making the world more interdependent than ever, so we are impacted by others more than ever.These accelerations are raising all the requirements for the American dream — they are raising the skill level and lifelong learning requirements for every good job; they are raising the bar on governance, the speed at which governments need to make decisions and the need for hybrid solutions that produce both stronger safety nets and more entrepreneurship to spawn more good jobs. They are also raising the bar on leadership, requiring leaders who can navigate this complexity and foster a resilient country.My own view is that these three accelerations have begun blowing up weak countries — see parts of the Middle East and Africa — and they’re just beginning to blow up the politics of strong ones. You can see it in America, Britain and Europe. The challenges posed by these accelerations, and what will be required to produce resilient citizens and communities, are forcing a politics that is much more of a hybrid of left and right.",politics
"PhotoChapel Hill, N.C. — TUESDAY is Primary Day in North Carolina, and while things like trade, immigration and the deficit will help people pick their candidate for president, there’s another issue that has an outsize impact on how the Tar Heel State votes: barbecue.Year in and year out, the way a politician approaches the question of cooked meat determines how he fares at the polls. As Herbert O’Keefe, the editor of The Raleigh Times in the 1950s, once said, “No man has ever been elected governor of North Carolina without eating more barbecue than was good for him.”In our state the linkage between politics and barbecue dates back at least to 1766, when the governor appointed by the king, William Tryon, tried to win the good will of citizens annoyed by the Stamp Act by laying on a barbecue in Wilmington. (It didn’t work: The local Sons of Liberty poured out the beer and threw the barbecued ox in the river. Note that this was a full seven years before the Boston Tea Party, which gets all the publicity.)In more recent times, barbecue has even figured as a campaign issue. When a North Carolina secretary of state, Rufus Edmisten, ran for governor in 1984, he got in trouble with an offhand remark. “I’d be eating barbecue three times a day for a solid year,” he later recalled, “and I got up one night and, in a very, very lax moment — the devil made me do it — I made a horrible statement. I said, ‘I’m through with barbecue.’ Well, you would have thought I had made a speech against my mother, against apple pie, cherry pie, the whole mess.” He lost the election to a Republican (only the second one to be elected since Reconstruction).Advertisement Continue reading the main storyWhen Elizabeth Dole and Erskine Bowles were contending for the Senate in 2002, they were asked if they preferred the vinegar-and-cayenne sauces of eastern North Carolina or the sauces of the Piedmont, which add a touch of ketchup.

"To the Editor:It’s not just that Big Money donors have an outsize influence on who wins elections (“Big Campaign Money Will Be Back,” editorial, March 1). The dominance of megadonors in the election process means that they determine who runs for office and who doesn’t, the narrative of election contests, and what policies are enacted or even considered legitimate. Most Americans perceive Big Money to be rigging the political system, and they are right.Remedies are at hand: overturning Citizens United and other Supreme Court decisions by constitutional amendment or a new jurisprudence; strong public financing measures for elections; stringent limits on outside spending; and robust contribution disclosure rules.While extensive polling shows that the public expresses overwhelming support for these measures, Congress fails to act. That’s why thousands of Americans will pour into Washington from April 16 to 18 for the Democracy Awakening mobilization, to demand far-reaching action to get Big Money out of politics, as well as to protect voting rights and win an up-or-down vote on a Supreme Court nominee.ROBERT WEISSMANPresident, Public CitizenWashington",politics
"I WAS not there, but I can imagine President Obama in the Oval Office posing this question about Judge Merrick B. Garland: “Given this man’s lengthy history on the bench and his impeccable reputation, what can be said against him serving on the Supreme Court?”The answer from his advisers might have been: “Nothing, sir. But the Republicans don’t want to give up their decades-long control of this court, and they would rather ignore the Constitution and freeze the government than allow that to happen.”When President Obama picked Judge Garland to fill Justice Antonin Scalia’s seat, he was choosing an extraordinarily well-qualified jurist. Judge Garland has served on the bench for 19 years, the last three as chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. No Supreme Court justices, even the greats, matched his record of federal judicial service at the time of their confirmation. His excellence as a jurist is surpassed only by the respect and affection people in both parties feel toward him.By sending the Senate a nominee of this quality and stature, President Obama has increased the political price Republicans will pay if they ignore their constitutional duty to provide advice and consent. That was the president’s objective from the start: Find a nominee beyond reproach who would, under normal circumstances, be confirmed without controversy. Force the Republicans to either back down or defend the indefensible.",politics
"As a result, candidates find themselves caught in an arms race: trying to raise enough money to compete, in contributions of $2,700 or less (far more than any middle-class family can spare), often facing opponents funding their own campaigns or incumbents with established fund-raising machines or outside money. There’s a natural pressure to find a way out of that trap, using whatever technique your lawyers and consultants cook up. That’s why every politician who has support from large donors now has a supportive super PAC.And there will always be a way out. The problem is not the Supreme Court — it’s the First Amendment itself. The challenge in regulating campaign spending is not deciding whether money is speech or corporations have rights, it’s defining the boundaries of the election. Elections are a special zone, and by regulating spending clearly intended to influence the election, we keep it a zone of political fairness, where voters hear all sides and elected officials can remain independent. (Think of it like the signs limiting electioneering within 75 feet of the polling place.)The provisions challenged in Citizens United and the earlier cases all dealt with the question, “What makes an ad an election ad?” Before 2002, the principle was that it had to have “magic words” like “vote for.” McCain-Feingold tried to establish that broadcast ads that mentioned a candidate 30 days before a primary or 60 days before an election would be considered campaign ads (“electioneering communication”). That’s what brought Citizens United, the organization, and its movie attacking Hillary Clinton, to the attention of the Federal Election Commission in 2008.But what about speech that mentions candidates long before an election? Or ads that don’t mention a candidate at all? For example, groups funded by the Koch family ran ads in the congressional elections of 2014 attacking “Obamacare” without ever mentioning a congressional candidate by name. When party and ideology are as tightly aligned as they are, an ad doesn’t need to connect all the dots to push a voter who dislikes President Obama’s health insurance program to vote Republican or an environmental activist to vote Democratic. But this kind of robust open debate about public issues is exactly what the First Amendment is intended to protect.Then there are all the other ways that the wealthy influence policy, without getting involved in elections — through media, lobbying and philanthropy. Each channel is legitimate and most efforts to restrict them would create more problems than they solved. What Mr. Sanders calls “the billionaire class” will not lose its influence even after all the court decisions back to 1976 have been reversed.It may be futile to try to restrict the influence of the very wealthy, but we can offset it by opening the system up and making it easier for a candidate to run and be heard, or for people working together to put a new idea on the agenda. Both Democratic presidential candidates have called for some kind of system of public financing that matches small donations, along the lines of New York City’s program, which matches small contributions six to one. Every current citywide elected official participated in the system, and small donors, including the match, accounted for 61 percent of the money spent in the 2013 elections.Seattle’s new program of vouchers, which gives every citizen $100 to donate to campaigns, is promising but so far untested, while some conservatives are enthusiastic about using tax credits to encourage small donors. While the Supreme Court has struck some provisions of these programs, they mostly remain intact, even in the Citizens United world, and a court without Justice Scalia is likely to be even friendlier to the idea of expanding political opportunity.",politics
"“Independence Day: Resurgence” brings back the aliens, this time squared off against the first female president of the United States, played by Sela Ward. “She’s strong, decisive and not afraid to kick ass!” Ms. Ward told People last year. That could help Hillary Clinton, as she heads toward a convention that may nominate her as the Democratic presidential candidate. Either way, Fox can reprise a film whose original took in more than $817 million at the worldwide box office._________“The Purge: Election Year”PhotoRelease: July 1Studio: Universal PicturesThis one, too, might score points for Mrs. Clinton. It’s the third installment in the writer-director James DeMonaco’s social-horror series about an annual, supposedly cathartic, government-sanctioned crime spree: “The Purge: Election Year” features a female presidential candidate.Universal last month added the magic words “Election Year” to the title of a film that was previously called just “The Purge 3.” Clearly, the studio plans to trade on electoral energy, and it has already made its intentions clear by running an advertising spot for the film during Democratic and Republican debates.It will stay ahead of the unforeseen or unpredictable — like a triumph by Mrs. Clinton’s Democratic rival Bernie Sanders — by opening before the convention._________“The Founder”PhotoRelease: Aug. 5Studio: The Weinstein Company“The Founder,” based on the story of the McDonald’s founder Ray Kroc, might be politically neutral. Or it might bounce against, say, Donald Trump, the Republican businessman who for the moment is leading the race for the party’s nomination. Harvey Weinstein, one of the wiliest political progressives in a movie industry filled with them, recently moved “The Founder” from a planned postelection release to early August.In explaining the shift, Mr. Weinstein — who backed “Fahrenheit 9/11” — said he meant to show that awards-worthy movies could be released at any time of year, not just in the crowded fourth quarter. But Mr. Kroc, like Mr. Trump, opposed an increase in the minimum wage. It is the sort of thing that seems sure to spark debate, especially if the film, directed by John Lee Hancock and starring Michael Keaton, wades into the politics behind a donation by Mr. Kroc to Richard Nixon in the early 1970s, when the minimum-wage issue, as now, was on the table. (Assuming, of course, that Mr. Trump emerges victorious from the July 18 Republican convention.)_________“Southside With You”PhotoRelease: Aug. 19Studio: Miramax and Roadside AttractionsWell received at the Sundance Film Festival in January, Richard Tanne’s “Southside With You,” about the beginning of a love affair between young Barack Obama, played by Parker Sawyers, and his future wife, Michelle Robinson, played by Tika Sumpter, is certain to play as a mildly inspirational, get-out-the-vote call for Democrats. That the film “has meticulously reverse-engineered our knowledge of the Obamas into a sweet, sexy, highly flattering youth portrait is less a criticism than a simple statement of fact,” wrote Justin Chang, in his review for Variety.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyBut in politics, every action has an opposite and sometimes even stronger reaction, noted the veteran consultant Christopher Lehane. In an email almost three years ago, he warned of a downside to the planned release of an indie film titled “Rodham,” a love story about young Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton that didn’t come together in time for the election cycle.“Of course, the political world (beyond fair time issues) will extrapolate deep political significance around whether it does or does not have commercial success,” Mr. Lehane wrote. The same caution may now apply to the gently partisan “Southside With You” — large or small, the box-office results may be seen as a gauge of political enthusiasm.For Miramax, which was sold this month to the beIN media group, the film underscores a commitment to backing fresh material, not just remakes and sequels from the library.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But it is not hard to imagine political operatives, in the heat of a presidential campaign, trying to appropriate it.On the surface, at least, Mr. Sullenberger’s stalwart, old-fashioned competence and grit seem to align with those who, like Mr. Trump, talk of “making America great again.” Indeed, in 2009, the Republican party tried to recruit Mr. Sullenberger as a candidate for a congressional seat in California, but he declined.Recall, too, that Mr. Eastwood spoke (to that empty chair) at the Republican convention in 2012, and delivered one of 2014’s surprise hits with the overtly patriotic “American Sniper.”“Sully” will most likely not do much for any candidate arriving on the left. But, given Mr. Eastwood’s strong record, it could land Warner in the next awards race._________“Snowden”PhotoRelease: Sept. 16Studio: Open Road FilmsOliver Stone’s “Snowden,” by contrast, will most likely outflank the mainstream presidential candidates on both left and right.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyDonald Trump has called on Apple to help law-enforcement authorities by unlocking its iPhones in a terror investigation, so a sympathetic cinematic look at Edward Snowden’s assault on government cyberintrusion won’t help him.But Mrs. Clinton, defending against those who say she violated cybersecurity rules while secretary of state, is in no position to buck Mr. Obama, who wants Mr. Snowden, played here by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, to return from Russian exile and stand trial for theft of secrets.One thing seems certain: Mr. Stone, who has become a fierce critic of Republicans, Democrats and general overreach by the federal government, will use “Snowden” and its promotional track to force candidates into a confrontation with his own considerable libertarian streak._________“The Birth of a Nation”Release: Oct. 9Studio: Fox Searchlight PicturesPolitically speaking, this is the big one: a brutal, anger-inducing drama about the Nat Turner slave rebellion.Written and directed by Nate Parker, who also stars, “The Birth of a Nation” played at Sundance and was immediately acquired by Fox Searchlight, for distribution in the heat of not just the presidential campaign but also the coming Oscar season.In Hollywood, the whispers say that Mr. Parker’s film — given the critical acclaim it has already received, and the backlash against this year’s nearly all-white Oscars — is sure to figure among the next wave of best picture nominees.On the political circuit, it will become as unavoidable as the torture debates around “Zero Dark Thirty” or the good governance talk that accompanied “Lincoln,” as candidates field questions about race relations in America._________...

"NEW DELHI — On the evening of Feb. 20 at around 8:40 p.m., while the graduate student Kanhaiya Kumar was locked up in Tihar Jail on sedition charges, his profile picture on Facebook was changed. The new photo, which showed a group of soldiers levering a flag-pole into a wasted hilltop, looked familiar except for one detail. In place of the Stars and Stripes flapping in the wind in Joe Rosenthal’s original 1945 shot of Iwo Jima, an Indian flag was flying full and proud.It is likely that Mr. Kumar’s account was hacked, and that his picture was replaced to signal that subversive thinking will always be surmounted by nationalists, like that hilltop by the valiant warriors.The same altered photo had recently been brandished on prime-time television by Sambit Patra, a spokesperson for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. “Look at our Indian soldiers!” he had remonstrated. “Indian soldiers, dying, but holding up the tricolor at the border.” The government has been quick to use images as political ammunition, never mind their veracity.The B.J.P. won its historic majority in 2014 thanks partly to its masterful handling of optics. Narendra Modi, who would become prime minister, often campaigned via hologram, even winning a place in the Guinness World Records for most simultaneous virtual appearances. But well into its second year in power, with TV media acting as enablers, an image-addicted B.J.P. risks losing both technical and ethical control over what it shows the country.",politics
"PhotoGood morning and happy New Year from Washington. We close 2014 with a tour of the echoing halls of an Obama-less White House, preview the books coming in 2015 from the top Republican presidential contenders and find the humor hidden away in former Gov. Jeb Bush’s many, many emails. On a more serious note, House Republicans end the year on a defensive note over Representative Steve Scalise’s 2002 speech to a white supremacist group.Will the long New Year’s weekend keep the Steve Scalise controversy from gaining momentum?Republican leaders hope so. They’ve already been forced to divert their focus from the new Congress that convenes next week to show their support for Mr. Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House. He is under fire for a 12-year-old speech he gave to a white supremacist group that goes by the acronym EURO.Democrats will certainly work to keep the issue alive into 2015, and some Republicans indicated on Tuesday that the problem would not go away anytime soon.“This is acidic for the Republican Party,” said Peter Wehner, a former adviser to President George W. Bush. “I just think it is an untenable position to have a person in the leadership of the Republican Party in the House who has spoken to a white supremacist group.”Mr. Scalise, in very abject terms, said he didn’t know the group’s racist history and regretted speaking to its members. Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and the House majority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, were vocal in their support of their colleague on Tuesday.More significant, Representative Cedric L. Richmond — the only Democrat and only African-American in the Louisiana congressional delegation — offered his backing. His advice to Mr. Scalise? Use the unwanted attention to speak out against the racial discrimination that still plagues communities nationwide.“He’s got a chance to write his own history,” Mr. Richmond said.— Steve KennyHow quiet are things in the nation’s capital? We thought a quick walk over to the White House might offer a clue.As we made it up the driveway past the northwest gate, we saw no Marine guard outside the West Wing’s main entrance. They’re on duty only when President Obama is in the building, and he’s in Hawaii.More telling were the dark windows to the left of the front door: the offices of Josh Earnest, the press secretary, and Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director, were empty and quiet — an unusual sight. The two administration officials hardly ever take a break from work.Inside the press section, the tiny rooms that serve as the White House bureaus for the major news organizations were also shut down and vacant: The Associated Press, CNN, CBS, ABC and NBC were all empty. The desks for The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times and the normally bustling area for White House photographers were deserted. (Reuters had a single reporter at her desk.)Two assistant press secretaries — Shawn Turner and Jessica Santillo — were at their computers. But upstairs, where Mr. Palmieri and Mr. Earnest work, the phones were silent, the computers were turned off, and the doors were shut.It’s all something of an illusion. Aides who travel with Mr. Obama on his annual vacation take the work of the White House to Hawaii. The political and national security machinery at the White House — along with news media coverage — stands at the ready if events warrant.But for those of us who spend time amid the barely controlled chaos, it’s always a bit of a surprise to see the White House so quiet.— Michael D. ShearThe trove of recently released Jeb Bush emails reveals the former Florida governor’s responsiveness to voters, his conservative instincts and even his facility with Spanish.But they also show his lighter side when it comes to dealing with criticism from constituents and the pitfalls of being an email addict.In 2000, when a constituent urged him to stay the course on his One Florida diversity initiative, Mr. Bush promised to push ahead, adding that he would check into problems at unisex bathrooms at highway rest stops.Oops. Mr. Bush followed up with an apology: “I am sorry about the sentence about the unisex bathrooms. That was supposed to go to another person who wrote me concerned about them!”Another exchange began when a resident of Newberry, Fla., called him a Nazi in disguise.“Chill out, John,” Mr. Bush advised. He recommended deep-breathing exercises as a relaxation technique.Mr. Bush played humble about his own fitness regimen in 2003 when State Senator Paula Dockery told him in an email that he was looking trim.The governor replied that he was actually “really out of shape” despite his daily walk to work. Perhaps, he said, it was a wardrobe illusion.“Bigger suits make me look thin,” Mr. Bush said.— Alan RappeportCan’t wait for the 2016 presidential campaign?

Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, is scheduled for release on Jan. 20. Besides the four G’s in the title, Mr. Huckabee takes time to talk about government bailouts, political appetites (we’re talking food) and a variety of other issues.Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky appears to be playing peacemaker in “Taking a Stand: Moving Beyond Partisan Politics to Unite America.” It comes out in June and details Mr. Paul’s four years in the Senate.Ted Cruz, the take-no-prisoners senator from Texas, also has a book that is to go on sale on May 12.

They each were the preferred dates of just 8 percent of respondents.None of them should expect to dine out on their bipartisan appeal. Mrs. Clinton was the most popular among Republicans, with just 15 percent of them willing to take her along on New Year’s Eve.

"PhotoGood Tuesday morning from Washington, where the combative Representative Michael G. Grimm, Republican of New York, has announced that he is stepping down; the antitax crusader Grover Norquist is giving Republicans credit for the economic recovery; and Representative Steve Scalise, Republican of Louisiana, is being asked to explain a speech he gave 12 years ago to a white supremacist group. In Hawaii, President Obama apologizes to a bride and groom who were forced to move their wedding for his golf game.Representative Michael G. Grimm of New York insisted last week that he would not resign from his seat, even after pleading guilty to federal tax evasion charges.On Monday night, he changed his mind.Mr. Grimm, 44, the only Republican House member from New York City, announced shortly before midnight that he did not believe that he could “continue to be 100 percent effective in the next Congress, and therefore, out of respect for the office and the people I so proudly represent, it is time to start the next chapter of my life.”He released the statement just hours after meeting with Speaker John A. Boehner.If he hadn’t resigned, Mr. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent, was facing House rules that would have severely restricted his ability to fulfill his functions as a congressman and would have left the 11th District — which includes Staten Island and part of Brooklyn — without effective representation until 2016.Mr. Grimm, once a rising star in Republican politics, was indicted in April, but he was overwhelmingly re-elected in November. He will officially step down on Jan. 5, and his sentencing is June 8. (Guidelines recommend that he get as much as three years in prison.)He will leave Congress with one indelible moment: his threat after this year’s State of the Union address to break a reporter in half and throw him off a Capitol balcony.— Jason HorowitzFederal lawmakers managed to close out the year by avoiding legislative infamy: They were not part of the most do-nothing Congress in history.But that’s only because they became so productive, comparatively, during the lame-duck session after the November elections.The winner, and the least-productive American Congress of all time, remains the 112th, by a slim margin.The Congress that wrapped up its business this month enacted 296 laws, according to a new Pew Research Center report. That’s 13 more pieces of legislation than had made it through the previous session.“When Congress broke for its election recess, it had passed just 185 laws, putting it on pace to be the least-productive in recent history,” said Drew DeSilver, a senior writer at Pew.And that legislative rally? “One might not have predicted such a finish,” he said.You also have to look at what Congress actually passed. There were significant pieces of legislation like the $1.1 trillion spending bill and a big defense policy measure. But there were also ceremonial honors, like the Congressional Gold Medal for the golfer Jack Nicklaus and honorary citizenship for the Spanish general Bernardo de Gálvez, a hero of the American Revolution who died more than 200 years ago. (Galveston, Tex., is named for him. You’d think that would be honor enough.)— Alan RappeportThe fallout was just starting Monday night after a liberal Louisiana blogger broke the story that Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the new House majority whip, had given a speech to a white supremacist and neo-Nazi group that goes by the acronym EURO.The speech was in 2002 — while Mr. Scalise was a state legislator — but it appears that the repercussions will play out in early 2015. Democrats were quick with a statement calling for Mr. Scalise to apologize and saying that the speech was “a serious stain on Scalise’s record as a public servant.” Speaker John A. Boehner’s office didn’t immediately comment.The report was heating up on Twitter, MSNBC and liberal blogs, and it could pose a headache for House Republicans who were looking for a smooth start to the 114th Congress next week. Mr. Scalise was elected to his position as the No. 3 leader in the House in June, in part to ease the bruised feelings of many hard-line conservatives, especially those from the South, who were feeling shut out of leadership.Trent Lott of Mississippi, the former Republican leader of the Senate, was tripped up by a similar controversy in 2002 over remarks he made at Senator Strom Thurmond’s 100th birthday party — words that some construed as support for Mr. Thurmond’s segregationist past. Mr. Lott stepped down from his leadership post two weeks later and left the Senate in 2007.— Steve KennyWith each new nugget of positive economic news, Republican dismissals of the recovery that is gathering steam have become less politically tenable.More than 300,000 new jobs in a month? How do you explain stagnant wages? Weekly wages were up, too? We’ll see about next month. Five percent economic growth?That might have been too much to ignore.So on Monday, Grover Norquist, the antitax crusader, may well have heralded a Republican shift on the economy. He credited the budding revival to the party’s austerity push.In a series of Twitter posts, Mr. Norquist noted that federal spending has dropped since 2011 to less than 20 percent of the economy from 24 percent — coinciding with Republican control of the House, the budget wars, automatic spending cuts, and even a government shutdown.Coincidence? In large part. The recovery is causing much of the drop in spending, not vice versa. The other big drop has come in defense as combat has ended in Iraq and, now, in Afghanistan.But spending at the discretion of Congress, a smaller part of the budget than automatic spending tied to Medicare, Social Security and interest on the debt, has shrunk to the smallest level as measured against the economy since the Eisenhower administration.Only now is government spending adding to economic growth. That is in part because the budget agreement between Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, loosened the reins on spending slightly.— Jonathan WeismanMayor Bill de Blasio of New York, struggling to quiet criticism over the deaths of two officers, meets with leaders of the city’s police unions.

According to an official briefed on the events surrounding the wedding, the golf course manager made the decision without conferring with the White House or the Secret Service.Had the manager done so, the official said, the president would have played at one of several other courses he has frequented. When the president took to the links on Sunday, he had no idea that he was displacing the couple, the official said.And when the White House learned that Bloomberg was preparing a story, Mr. Obama called the bride to apologize. “The president of the United States still felt bad and called the bride!” the official said. “Per her quotes in the story, she’s absolutely thrilled.

"PhotoGood morning on the last Monday of the year from Washington, where federal officials are awaiting calls for assistance involving AirAsia Flight 8501, and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, fresh off his announcement that he is exploring a presidential campaign, has a big lead in a new poll over other potential Republican contenders. We also start wrapping up the year by tallying statistics from President Obama’s Hawaiian vacation and looking at the Twitter champions in Congress.Mr. Obama is halfway through his year-end trip to Hawaii. While he has kept a low profile, he’s been fairly busy. Here’s a breakdown:9 – Number of days the president has been in Hawaii.6 – Number of times he has played golf.7 – Number of golf partners. (His childhood friends Mike Ramos, Greg Orme and Bobby Titcomb; the White House staff members Mike Brush and Joe Paulsen; Prime Minister Najib Razak of Malaysia; the lawyer Preston Heard.)2 – Number of putts Mr. Obama missed on the 18th green on Wednesday when reporters were allowed to see him finish a round with Mr. Najib.2 – Number of putts the Malaysian prime minister missed on the 18th green.1 – Number of times the president has bowled with friends when it was too rainy to golf.4 – Number of times he has worked out at a local military base.4 – Number of Obama family beach trips.1 – Number of first family hikes.2 – Number of times the White House spokesman has announced that Mr. Obama was briefed on breaking news events (the New York City police shootings in one case, and the missing plane in Asia in the other).2 – Number of police chiefs the president has called (William J. Bratton of New York and Charles H. Ramsey of Philadelphia).1 – The number of times Mr. Obama has praised the former senator and presidential candidate Gary Hart. He thanked Mr. Hart, who was appointed as special envoy to Northern Ireland in October, “for his hard work in support of” this month’s Stormont House Agreement, shoring up the power-sharing government in Northern Ireland— Michael S. SchmidtFor Congress, 2014 was a really productive year — on Twitter, at least. Nearly every current member of the House and Senate who has an account increased his or her follower count on the social media site, according to data tracked by The New York Times.Representative Trey Gowdy, the South Carolina Republican, saw his social media profile rise significantly in a year when he was elevated to the chairmanship of a select committee investigating the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya. His 192 percent increase in followers since the beginning of the year tops all lawmakers who have at least 1,000 followers.Others who saw substantial increases included Representative Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican who is the new House majority whip; Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts; and Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the Florida Republican who gained a large number of followers after posting about antigovernment protests in Venezuela. (We tracked only official accounts, not personal ones, meaning that some lawmakers with popular personal accounts on Twitter, such as Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, weren’t included.)Perhaps the most unexpected Twitter growth came from Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat and dean of the House who is retiring after 59 years in Congress. Like many lawmakers, he relies on staff members for day-to-day maintenance of his Internet presence. Mr. Dingell had 9,587 followers on Jan. 1 but had more than 23,000 by late December.There were exceptions to the pattern of rapid gains. Some members’ accounts experienced growth in the single digits, and those who leave Congress usually see at least some of their followers fall away. But for the most part, to be a member of Congress meant to gain followers.— Derek WillisThe new year is shaping up as one of change and challenges for health care and the Affordable Care Act, although the open enrollment period has gone smoothly so far.As state legislatures convene in coming weeks, many will again wrestle with the question of whether to expand Medicaid. Several Republican governors have expressed new interest, but they face skeptical legislators in their own party. Ohio and Arkansas, which expanded Medicaid this year, will refight those battles in 2015.And for a third straight year, the Supreme Court will take up issues arising from the Affordable Care Act, among them a challenge to the subsidies that make coverage affordable. If critics prevail, millions of people in states that use the federal insurance exchange could lose their subsidies.A ruling against the subsidies could create a political quandary for Republicans, whom Democrats would accuse of taking insurance from the needy. A more general question for 2015 is how Republicans will use their new control of Congress. Will they send President Obama a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act? Will they pass legislation to chip away at it? Will the Obama administration negotiate with Republicans over such changes?Or will Mr. Obama use his veto power to beat back all changes? And, finally, will Republican presidential candidates continue to insist on repeal?In March and April, many taxpayers will, for the first time, face what the individual mandate means to them. On their tax returns, they will need to certify that they had insurance in 2014 or qualified for an exemption, or else they will have to pay a penalty, the “individual shared responsibility payment.”— Robert PearRequests for American help from Indonesia, Malaysia or Singapore into the investigation of the AirAsia flight.

The shirts are a “throwback to the days of strong, principled leadership in the White House,” the committee says. (They are also a throwback to a very good year for Republican presidential politics: President Ronald Reagan carried 49 states.)“Reagan/Bush ’84” is also the all-time top seller at RetroPolitics.com, a nonpartisan site, followed by “Clinton/Gore ’92” and its “Bull Moose” shirt, although “Mondale/Ferraro” and “Chisholm ’72” showed strong sales this year, said Adam Samons, the site’s founder.This isn’t the first time Republicans have opened their closet to raise money. The party’s national committee also sells “limited edition” striped socks embroidered with an elephant and the signature of the elder President George Bush.

"PhotoGood Wednesday morning from Washington, which has been abandoned by both the president and Congress and where Christmas is a season to be silly. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is using his Twitter account to celebrate the Festivus holiday from “Seinfeld,” and we share our favorite political Christmas cards. On more serious notes, the elder President George Bush has been taken to a Houston hospital after experiencing shortness of breath, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will attend the service on Saturday for Officer Rafael Ramos, the slain New York City police officer.Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida is not the only high-profile Republican who has recently recalled Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign in less-than-flattering terms.At this month’s Republican National Committee fund-raiser at the Union League Club in New York City, the party’s chairman, Reince Priebus, was confronted by a donor who pleaded with him to do his best to avoid a replay of the last presidential campaign. The donor specifically lamented that Mr. Romney had little time to reposition himself for swing voters in the general election after running to the right in the primaries.Mr. Priebus said the raucous 2012 primary season was not entirely to blame. The chairman recalled Mr. Romney’s infamous “47 percent” comment about Americans who pay no taxes, and he noted reports that the Romney family had a car elevator at its beach home in California and owned a horse that won a spot in the Olympic dressage competition.A Republican who was at the fund-raiser — and who is not committed to any potential 2016 candidate — said Mr. Priebus was trying “to remind donors deluded by a Romney repeat run just how terrible a campaign Romney ’12 was.”Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee, offered a different interpretation. He said that Mr. Priebus was trying to make the point that even though the party was overhauling the primary process, there were some matters that could not be addressed by changes in the debate schedule or primary calendar.“You can’t blame the system,” he said, “when things are said on our side that were unforced errors.”— Jonathan MartinThe elder President George Bush was taken to a Houston hospital on Tuesday night after experiencing shortness of breath, according to a family spokesman.Mr. Bush, 90, would be held at least overnight at Houston Methodist Hospital as a precaution, the spokesman, Jim McGrath, said.The former president spent nearly two months at Houston Methodist — including a week in the intensive care unit — in late 2012 and early 2013 with a bronchitis-related cough and fever.Mr. Bush, the oldest living former president (he is about four months older than Jimmy Carter), has a form of Parkinson’s disease and often uses a wheelchair or scooter to get around. Yet he went skydiving on his 90th birthday in June.Last month, Mr. Bush participated in the coin toss at the Houston Texans game against the Cincinnati Bengals. During the game, he and his wife, Barbara, were caught by the stadium’s “kiss cam.”— Steve KennyPresident Obama is spending his days in Hawaii working out, golfing (when the unpredictable weather permits) and bowling with friends.In other words, Tuesday was the perfect time for the White House to update the nation on the gross domestic product estimate for the third quarter.It was the latest dense economic report that the White House has fed to reporters here in Kailua, Hawaii, who are assigned to cover Mr. Obama’s (so far) uneventful family vacation during what is traditionally the slowest news week of the year.On Monday, it was an advance look at a report with an exceedingly boring title: “Year of Action: A Final Progress Report on the Obama Administration’s Actions to Help Create Opportunities for All Americans.” The White House recommended it as “good reading on this stormy beach day!”The economic numbers released on Tuesday really were good news. Real gross domestic product grew 5 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter — the strongest single quarter since 2003, according to an estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.But still not a good beach read.— Amy ChozickOur mailboxes here at First Draft are always a little more full this time of year, stuffed with green-and-red holiday greetings from our city’s political professionals.While we certainly don’t receive as many as our friends in Iowa, which was blanketed this year by cards from Mitt Romney, Ted Cruz, Chris Christie, Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, we thought we’d share a few of our favorites.Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat who has retired from the Senate after nearly four decades of service, sent a traditional card featuring a photo of his family, although the American flag in the background pretty much overwhelms the Harkins.Senator Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota Democrat, reminded us of her Gopher State pride with four photos of her state’s traditions, including the “All You Can Drink Milk Booth” at the Minnesota State Fair.Fix the Court, a grass-roots group seeking changes in the way the Supreme Court operates, isn’t letting the holidays get in the way of its message. It sent around a parody card with a faux-redacted note from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. (His smiling face graces the front.)But our favorite was from the Biden family. Not only did they send us more than a dozen copies of the same card, and addressed one of our White House reporters as “president” of The New York Times, but the photo features Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s wild ride on a whitewater raft.And it’s signed at the end with a paw print from the Bidens’ dog, Champ.— Nick CorasanitiThe Labor Department releases its weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. Last week’s numbers were the lowest level since October and a sign of growing confidence among employers.At 10 a.m., Freddie Mac will release the weekly mortgage rates.For Senator Rand Paul, it truly is a Festivus for the rest of us.The Kentucky senator dropped hints yesterday that he was a big fan of the “holiday” made famous on “Seinfeld.” (For a brief explainer, we cede to Mr. George Costanza via YouTube. For the full story, here’s the episode’s script.)Mr. Paul, using his Twitter account, spent much of Tuesday partaking in a Festivus tradition known as the “Airing of Grievances.”One post rippled the Twittersphere: Mr. Paul predicted that a black turtleneck with the words “Rand Paul 2016” on the shoulder “will be a popular item this year.” (He helpfully provided an image.) What was left unsaid is that while Mr. Paul may run for president, he is definitely seeking re-election as Kentucky’s junior senator.Among his many Festivus grievances:– Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey doesn’t retweet Mr. Paul enough.– Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky won’t let Mr. Paul borrow his “awesome sweater vest.”– Everyone else in Washington wears a blue suit, so when Mother Jones named Mr. Paul “best dressed in Washington” it wasn’t “really a contest.”– The news media is obsessed with Mr. Paul’s hair.– The government is wasting tax dollars on things like Swedish massages for rabbits.– Mr. Paul still doesn’t know if the erstwhile Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes voted for President Obama.– Politics doesn’t involve enough puppies.— Nick CorasanitiThe Food and Drug Administration will ease the ban on blood donations by gay and bisexual men that was imposed in 1983 over H.I.V. fears.Some theaters have agreed to screen “The Interview” in defiance of North Korea.

"PhotoGood Tuesday morning from Washington, where congressional Republicans are planning a getaway to draw up a unity agenda, and where lawmakers are pushing President Obama to defy North Korea by screening “The Interview” at the White House. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio faces a political crisis over the fatal shooting of two police officers by an African-American man.Mayor Bill de Blasio has long been reluctant to relinquish his image as an activist, even after becoming the most powerful politician in New York City.But the difficulties of that dual role are becoming stark after the fatal shooting of two police officers, forcing Mr. de Blasio to confront long-simmering tensions with the Police Department he oversees.The mayor, who usually strives to avoid antagonizing his left-leaning base, has called for a moratorium on street protests until after the officers’ funerals. He has made a bid for calm, but some liberal activists say the mayor is trying to suppress free speech.Mr. de Blasio plans to observe a moment of silence for the fallen officers at 2:47 p.m. Tuesday — three days to the minute after the shooting of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu.There have been questions about how the deaths of Officers Ramos and Liu would affect the protest movement that has grown from the deaths of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Missouri, both of whom were killed by police officers.The debate found new life yesterday in Milwaukee, where Representative Gwen Moore, Democrat of Wisconsin, pushed for a Justice Department inquiry into the April shooting and death of a black man by a white officer in a public park. A local prosecutor said the shooting was justified and declined to bring charges in the case on Monday.“This decision is just one of many in recent weeks that continue to perpetuate a disheartening notion that there is a significant lapse in accountability for reckless officers and the behavior they employ in our communities,” Ms. Moore said.— Michael M. Grynbaum and Carl HulseSince there are joint sessions of Congress, there might as well be joint retreats. So House and Senate Republicans have decided they will meet together on Jan. 15 and 16 in Hershey, Pa., to plan for what they have called the “Congress of Tomorrow.”Officials have been weighing the idea since it became clear that the Republican Party would control both chambers in the 114th Congress. The retreat is a recognition that House and Senate Republicans intend to operate mostly in concert, which has not always been the case under single-party control.In 1995, House and Senate Republicans clashed repeatedly after Newt Gingrich led a takeover of the House. In one notorious example, Mr. Gingrich, as speaker, and Senator Bob Dole, the Senate leader at the time, split publicly over government shutdowns that did not end well for the Republicans.The current speaker, John A. Boehner, and the incoming majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, have a strong working relationship. And there is plenty to bring Republicans together: their opposition to President Obama’s immigration policy, the push for a balanced budget and, to a lesser extent, the president’s new opening to Cuba.— Carl HulseWith one of the most ineffective Congresses the United States has ever seen now one for the history books, members of the incoming 114th Congress are lining up initiatives to get started on early.Up first: Movie night!Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, has called on President Obama to screen “The Interview” at the White House, both as an act of defiance after the cyberattack on Sony Pictures that has been attributed to North Korea and as a way to open a discussion on how the United States could best respond.The hacking has so far succeeded in its goal of stopping distribution of the comedy, which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco and is about a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Theaters canceled showings and Sony indefinitely delayed the movie’s release after emails warned of terrorist attacks against places that screened it.If Mr. Vitter gets his way, the world premiere would be early next month at Washington’s most famous address. “I ask that you host a screening of comedy film ‘The Interview’ for members of Congress in the White House the week of Jan. 5,” Mr. Vitter wrote on Friday. “To be followed by a serious discussion of the strong, substantive retaliatory measures we plan to take as a nation against cyberattacks.”If that doesn’t pan out, Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California and chairman of the Entertainment Industries Caucus, has another plan. He sent a letter to Sony yesterday requesting that Congress get a screening of the movie to “know, and see, what we are talking about.”— Nick CorasanitiThe case of Representative Michael G. Grimm, the New York Republican who is expected to plead guilty to a felony count of tax evasion as early as Tuesday, could present a challenge to party leaders who have previously drawn a hard line on ethics transgressions.Mr. Grimm has indicated that he will step aside if he is convicted, but it is not certain he will do so. If he does not resign, Speaker John A. Boehner and his team will have to decide whether to pressure Mr. Grimm, a former F.B.I. agent, to step down and clear the way for a special election to replace him. An Ethics Committee investigation could also lead to a recommendation that Mr. Grimm be expelled or censured.Republicans lost their majority in 2006, in part because of a series of ethics scandals, and Mr. Boehner has been aggressive in seeking to push out Republicans who put the party in a bad light. But some members have resisted, like Trey Radel, a Florida congressman who for months rejected calls to step aside after he was arrested on cocaine charges. He ultimately decided to quit.Republican leaders made no public comment on Monday about Mr. Grimm’s fate, but they are likely to prefer that he leave on his own rather than that he have to be pushed.— Carl HulsePresident Obama is in Hawaii and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is in Delaware. Congress is in recess.The Commerce Department is releasing a slew of economic reports starting at 8:30 a.m.: personal income and spending for November, third-quarter gross domestic product, durable goods for November and new-home sales for November.The forecast for President Obama’s Hawaiian vacation: rain.A tropical downpour ruled out a golf outing yesterday, so Mr. Obama headed to the gym for a 45-minute workout at the Marine Corps Air Station at Kaneohe Bay. More rain is expected through Wednesday — fitting, perhaps, for a vacation that has been interrupted by major news events.There was the cyberattack on Sony Pictures attributed to North Korea, with the president promising to “respond proportionally.” (On Monday, North Korea suffered a widespread and unexplained Internet outage.) The administration is also feeling pressure stemming from the murder of two police officers in Brooklyn that has only heightened racial tensions across the country. And Mr. Obama’s decision to open diplomatic relations with Cuba is still playing out politically back on the mainland.Mr. Obama is fortified in a palm tree paradise, in a compound that is not visible to the small pool of reporters who follow him, but that is, we’re told, in a lush subdivision in Kailua, Hawaii.Before the clouds moved in, Mr. Obama, his wife and daughters, and their motorcade traveled through the scenic Oahu countryside on Sunday to Bellows Air Force Base Beach, where they joined friends for some private beach time.That night, the Obamas dined at the Morimoto restaurant in The Modern, a sleek hotel in Waikiki famous for its frozen coconut mojitos.That’s not to say the president is actually relaxing. Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, said that Mr. Obama “is always briefed as appropriate” and that “Hawaii is no different.” He was mum about the specifics.— Amy ChozickMayor Bill de Blasio of New York asks that “hands up, don’t shoot” protests be suspended in the wake of the fatal ambush of two of the city’s officers.North Korea is unplugged from the Internet, for a time, anyway.The State Department official who negotiates the transfer of prisoners from Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, is resigning, dealing a blow to the effort to close the prison.The 20th reunion of Stanford’s Class of ’94 put the Silicon Valley’s gender gap on vivid display.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky acknowledges it will be challenging to change the mind-set of a Republican caucus whose opposition to the president he was instrumental in leading.Establishment Republicans in Utah are tired of Senator Mike Lee’s unrelentingly conservative style and are looking to unseat him in 2016, according to Politico.The Wall Street Journal says former Gov.

"PhotoGood Tuesday morning from Washington, where dozens of federal judges have been confirmed since Senator Harry Reid’s end-run of the Senate rules, the nation finally has a new surgeon general, and President Obama will be monitoring an unfolding crisis in Pakistan, where the Taliban attacked a school. Plus, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida schedules a strategy session with an eye on a 2016 presidential campaign.As they plow through backlogged presidential nominations in their final days in the majority, Senate Democrats say the numbers prove they made the right move last year in changing the rules to allow them to break a nominee filibuster with a simple majority vote.Twelve Federal District Court nominees face votes this week. If they are confirmed, Democrats will have installed more than 80 of Mr. Obama‘s candidates on the federal trial bench since November 2013.Perhaps more important, they will have put 14 of Mr. Obama’s choices on the influential federal appeals courts, tipping the overall balance in favor of judges appointed by Democrats.The impact hasn’t just involved the courts and the lifetime appointments there. In the past year, the Senate has confirmed dozens of executive branch officials and ambassadors who faced serious Republican resistance. The latest was Dr. Vivek H. Murthy, the new surgeon general, approved Monday night by a 51-to-43 vote.Republicans say Democrats could have achieved essentially the same results without tinkering with the rules. But that seems unlikely.Democrats believe they have managed to bolster the executive branch for the remainder of Mr. Obama’s time in office while reshaping the federal judiciary for a generation.— Carl HulseSenator Marco Rubio of Florida will gather over 100 Republican donors, fund-raisers and other supporters at a luxury hotel in Miami next month for a two-day strategy session about Mr. Rubio’s political future, according to an invitation obtained by The New York Times.The conference, scheduled to begin Jan. 23 at the Delano hotel in South Beach, will be hosted by Mr. Rubio’s leadership political action committee, Reclaim America, and it is expected to draw supporters from Washington and South Florida. The event comes as Mr. Rubio and other potential 2016 candidates are quietly but aggressively jockeying for the allegiance of the Republican Party’s leading donors and fund-raising “bundlers.”Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rick Perry, who is wrapping up his tenure as Texas governor, have already held gatherings of supporters and donors, and Mitt Romney recently met with backers of his 2012 campaign. The competition is especially keen because so many candidates with strong ties to Republican donors are considering White House bids — and relatively few donors have made formal commitments.Mr. Rubio’s get-together will include a welcome reception on Friday and a “political update” on Saturday morning, led by the senator and Terry Sullivan, his political adviser and the director of his political action committee. The invitation’s letterhead reads “Team Marco 2016.” Should Mr. Rubio decide against a presidential campaign, he would still need to run for re-election.“Marco’s made it clear he’ll be on the ballot in 2016,” Mr. Sullivan said. “We just have to decide for what office.”— Nicholas ConfessoreSurgeon general nominees used to breeze through Congress.But America’s top doctor has become more of a political job in recent years, and that played out in the drawn-out confirmation of Dr. Vivek H. Murthy.President Obama nominated him 13 months ago, but he wasn’t confirmed until Monday night, with the support of just one Republican — Senator Mark S. Kirk of Illinois.Dr. Murthy, 37, is the youngest surgeon general and the first of Indian descent, and Senate opponents pointed out that he completed his medical training only eight years ago. His outspoken support of gun control laws and the Affordable Care Act didn’t help either.The job was conceived in the 1870s to oversee the Marine Hospital Service. Recent surgeons general have become advocates of AIDS prevention and smoking bans and have become embroiled in the abortion debate.President Reagan’s surgeon general, C. Everett Koop, was confirmed only after an eight-month fight but became a household name. Dr. Joycelyn Elders was forced to resign 14 months into her tenure after she condoned the idea that teaching children to masturbate would help curb the spread of H.I.V.— Alan RappeportOne of the main spoils of winning the Senate is control of its committees, and Republicans finished parceling out seats on Monday, shuffling appointments of veteran senators and finding assignments for 12 new members.Four freshmen Republicans were awarded seats on the Appropriations Committee, a sign of how much prestige that panel has lost. It once required serious seniority to win an Appropriations appointment, but that was when the focus was on spending, rather than cutting.On the other hand, five incoming senators grabbed seats on the Armed Services Committee, showing the appeal of national security issues.Much of the attention is on the Budget Committee, where the membership will decide a fight for the chairmanship between Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming. The committee got two new members, Bob Corker of Tennessee and David Perdue of Georgia, one of the newcomers.Several senators said Mr. Enzi had the edge in winning the chairmanship but that it would be close.

That was one of the milder barbs thrown in Mr. Christie’s direction.He laughed about it during a call to an Atlantic City radio station. “I call it as I see it,” he said. “I’m not going to be one of those politicians who changes their team loyalties just to score some political points.”— Steve KennyPresident Obama, in a speech at a New Jersey military base, announced that the United States and its allies had halted the momentum of the Islamic State militant group.The United States has opened its largest immigration detention center.

"PhotoGood Monday morning from Washington, where Prince William is making his first-ever visit to the capital, 2016 opposition research is getting into the swing, and members of Congress are rushing to finish their business and get home for the holidays. Plus, Nancy Pelosi reveals to First Draft the origins of her love of dark chocolate.The 113th Congress on Monday heads into what most lawmakers hope is its final week, but there is plenty to do before it can be relegated to the history books.Most important, the House and the Senate must find a way to keep the government open past Thursday. A huge spending package funding most of the government is set to become public as early as Monday evening, sending members of Congress and watchdog groups scurrying to find out exactly what it holds. House Republican leaders, undeterred by objections from conservatives, hope to pass the measure by Wednesday and push a fight over President Obama‘s new immigration policy into next year.At the same time, the Senate needs to take action on a major Pentagon policy measure already passed by the House and a one-year extension of popular tax breaks. Then the question becomes whether Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader, is serious about keeping the Senate around to consider nominations before handing over control to Republicans.Besides the must-pass bills, Congress has other big issues on its plate.The special House committee on the Benghazi, Libya, attacks will hold a hearing on Wednesday on efforts to secure embassy facilities, calling two State Department officials as witnesses. Though a recent report by the House Intelligence Committee found that the C.I.A. and the military acted properly in their response to the attacks, Republicans have indicated they expect to pursue the issue at least through 2015.Secretary of State John Kerry is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the push to authorize using force against the Islamic State. Democratic members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are poised to release a summary of their review of C.I.A. torture of terrorism detainees, if they can overcome final objections from the Obama administration. And Senate Republicans will meet on Tuesday to discuss whether to reverse a Democratic change in filibuster rules.With all that in the air, Congress also will find time to litigate the Affordable Care Act. The House Oversight Committee is convening a Tuesday hearing on the health care law, calling Jonathan Gruber, a former administration health care consultant, to grill him about comments he made suggesting that “stupid” voters and government secrecy helped pass the law.Then Christmas break can begin.There’s a new phrase finding its way into the remarks of Speaker John A. Boehner and fellow Republican leaders when they talk about next year: the “new American Congress.”Mr. Boehner said it at least twice last week, and others have uttered variations. It was notable since the typical formulation would simply be the new Congress or new Republican Congress.And, of course, Congress is always American.Republicans say the phrasing is deliberate and is meant to convey the message that the incoming Congress with both the House and the Senate under Republican control will be more responsive to the concerns and priorities of everyday Americans. But they say they don’t expect it to become a frequent element of the speaker’s talking points and won’t rival “where are the jobs,” for instance.— Carl HulseNo Republican has yet made a formal presidential announcement, but American Bridge is not waiting.The liberal group is releasing a bound book on Monday of opposition research on the potential Republican presidential field. Covering 20 would-be contenders, the “2016 Scouting Report” is a 194-page compilation of innocuous biographical information alongside unflattering pictures and potentially damaging anecdotes and issue positions. Nearly a third of the tome is endnotes, a signal to reporters who may use the information that it is all sourced.Brad Woodhouse, the president of American Bridge, called the book “the most comprehensive early look at a presidential field that has ever been assembled.”Aside from the many period pictures – a young John R. Kasich with Richard M. Nixon, Nikki R. Haley with Strom Thurmond – this is mostly “votes and quotes” information, gleaned from the public record and news media accounts.It is also, Mr. Woodhouse notes, only the start. The online version of the book will be continually updated on American Bridge’s website.— Jonathan MartinThere will be no shortage of star power on display on Monday when Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, meets with Hillary Rodham Clinton and Chelsea Clinton for a wildlife conservation reception at the British consul’s residence in New York.While the Clintons are sometimes seen as American royalty, it’s not every day that they mix with the real thing.Of course, Mrs. Clinton and the duke are not strangers. She had a close relationship with his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.After Diana’s death in 1997, Mrs. Clinton was chosen to represent the United States in an unofficial capacity at the princess’s funeral. Since it was not a state function, President Bill Clinton did not attend, and there was no official American delegation.But Mrs. Clinton was not sent without some political calculation. According to documents released by the Clinton Library last March, Robert A. Bradtke, deputy chief at the American Embassy in London at the time, was concerned about Mrs. Clinton speaking to reporters on her trip.Calling her the most prominent guest at the funeral, he advised that she make a short statement but take no questions to avoid entanglement in “increasingly nasty palace politics.”As for the duke and his wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, they are expected to avoid the fray of American politics and focus on conservation, the arts and youth education programs on their visit.— Alan RappeportHillary Rodham Clinton is not the only one meeting with the visiting British royalty.

Very dark chocolate.She doesn’t “eat chocolate once per day, but constantly,” Ms. Pelosi told First Draft. “It’s an ongoing thing.”“If there were one food I would have in life, it would be very dark chocolate ice cream,” she said. “If it were not invented, I would have had to invent it.”Ms. Pelosi, a Democrat, has loved chocolate since her childhood in the Little Italy neighborhood of Baltimore, where she enjoyed parfaits at the corner store and, of course, gelato. At age 5, she tried to dispose a tub of vanilla ice cream — a gift from her brother. “It clogged the drains,” she said.Ben and Jerry’s New York Super Fudge Chunk ice cream is her clear favorite. She also keeps on hand Ghirardelli squares — a home-state product — and See’s Candies are a go-to for gifts.“In the desk, in the purse, readily available at hand,” she said of her stash. “It’s a wonderful thing.”She also believes in chocolate diplomacy.

"PhotoGood Friday morning from Washington, where Democrats are celebrating an unexpected number of Senate confirmations and the Capitol is still echoing with the unusually large number of farewell speeches. But with President Obama and Congress leaving town, the city prepares for two weeks of silent nights after a last-minute burst of Cuba controversy. From New York, Maureen Dowd has the backstage scoop at Stephen Colbert’s last “Report.”President Obama leaves Friday for a two-week vacation in Hawaii, ending a frantic three-week stretch that saw Congress fitfully conclude its business just hours before the president made his announcement that he was restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba.As is the custom, the president is scheduled to meet with reporters before his departure, and much of the questioning will no doubt center on his decision to renew ties with Havana.There are plenty of other subjects to pursue: his aggressive exercise of executive authority; the administration’s strong defense of the C.I.A. director after the release of the Senate’s torture report; the cyberattack on Sony Pictures; and his expectations for the new Republican Congress.Mr. Obama has complicated that relationship with the historic Cuba decision and his unilateral move to ease deportations of immigrants living in the country illegally. But the president and his advisers seem to have calculated that with the midterms behind them — and new Republican muscle in front of them — the president might just as well pursue his agenda on his own.Congress doesn’t return until Jan. 6, and the president is not due back until after New Year’s Day. That means the capital could be in store for a relatively quiet period after a year with plenty of partisan conflict and a decisive Republican triumph in last month’s elections. But as recent events have shown, news has a timetable of its own.— Carl HulseGoodbyes are never easy, especially when you are leaving the comfortable confines of Congress. And this year, the valedictory speeches were always emotional, sometimes salty and occasionally awkward.Senator Mark Pryor of Arkansas revealed that he had reunited with a junior high school girlfriend, a woman named Joi. “So when I say God has brought joy in my life,” he said, “I mean it, literally.” (They were engaged during the lame-duck session that just ended.)For Senator Mark Begich of Alaska, a confession was in order. During his tearful so-long, Mr. Begich admitted that he had once sneaked his son into the Senate chamber and took pictures, violating its rules against photography.“I will cherish that photo,” he said.Over in the House, Representative Michele Bachmann was in sermon mode, telling a smattering of colleagues that the Ten Commandments were the foundation of American law. She offered thanks to her donors, her family and her “prayer warriors.”But none of the speeches lived up to the blunt final address of Senator Ernest Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who retired in 2005 after almost 40 years in office.“We had,” he said, “five drunks or six drunks when I came here. There’s nobody drunk in the United States Senate. We don’t have time to be drunk.”He wasn’t through, reminiscing that Margaret Chase Smith of Maine was the only woman in the Senate when he arrived, and “she was outstandingly quiet.”“Now we’ve got 15 or 17, and you can’t shut them up.”— Alan RappeportThe Democrats enjoyed unexpected success in the final days of Congress, ramming through scores of presidential nominees.But the Senate returned more than 150 nominations to the White House, including candidates for senior agency positions, judicial nominees and ambassadors as well as many requests for military promotion. They will all have to await the new Congress.Some of the nominees will return, with Loretta E. Lynch, the president’s choice for attorney general, heading the list. But others are not expected to see their names back before the Senate, including Michael P. Boggs, a Federal District Court nominee from Georgia. His nomination ran aground because many of Mr. Obama’s fellow Democrats did not like the positions he embraced as a Georgia state legislator.Antonio F. Weiss, an investment banker and nominee for a top Treasury post, is in the sights of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and the Democrats’ progressive wing, mainly because of his Wall Street background. Still, Democrats are celebrating how many of the president’s choices they were able to put in place.— Carl HulseThe Times’s lead headline on April 18, 1959, was a welcome one to many here in Washington: “Castro Declares Regime Is Free of Red Influence.”It had been less than four months since Fidel Castro had seized power in Havana from the dictator Fulgencio Batista, and the future dictator of Cuba was on an unofficial good-will tour of the United States. He was mobbed at National Airport, addressed the American Society of Newspaper Editors, lunched with the acting secretary of state and met with Vice President Richard M. Nixon.He even went to the Capitol, where, for an hour and a half, he sought to assure members of the Senate Foreign Relations and the House Foreign Affairs Committees that his intentions were benign. “I have said very clearly,” The Times quoted him as saying, “that we are not Communists.”It wasn’t a controversy-free visit. Mr. Castro was dogged by protesters at every stop. Still, The Times reported that Washington was “so dazed” by the 32-year-old leader that after his departure, “this town will then try to sort out its impressions of the bearded young man who has been holding it by its lapels for five days.”Yet there was a hint of what was to come, and it was found in a subhead on The Times’s story about Castro’s remarks:“Executions Defended.”— Steve KennyPresident Obama gives a pre-vacation news conference before heading off to Hawaii.Former Gov.

Mr. Stewart kissed Mr. Colbert on the cheek and told him he loved him.Mr. Colbert also thanked his group of erstwhile guests for putting up with “that idiot,” noting that sometimes he didn’t know what he was talking about.“He’s worse than a politician,” Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington’s nonvoting congressional delegate, joked as she and Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, watched Mr. Colbert linger talking onstage afterward. “He goes on and on and on.”— Maureen DowdThe Obama administration is moving quickly on its plans to normalize relations with Cuba.

"PhotoGood Monday morning from Washington, where President Obama is under pressure to address growing racial tensions after the fatal shootings of two New York City police officers. In Brooklyn, Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, placed flowers at a memorial to the officers. Reacting to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures, Republicans are calling on Mr. Obama to take a firmer stance against North Korea. Also, we review 2014 with a slide show of our Washington staff’s best photographs.President Obama is facing renewed pressure to respond to racial tensions that have been building since the police shooting this summer of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and that took another turn with an African-American man’s fatal ambush of two New York officers over the weekend.When he was elected in 2008, Mr. Obama — the son of a black father and a white mother — was hailed as a leader who could bridge lingering racial divides. Instead, he finds himself serving during a time of heightened tensions, with a Bloomberg Politics poll released early this month in which 53 percent of respondents said race relations had grown worse during Mr. Obama’s tenure.For the most part, the president has responded with caution, in stark contrast to the soaring language he issued to discuss racial issues during the 2008 presidential campaign. And he has faced widespread conservative criticism when he has tried to address the issue — as when he said “if I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon” amid the uproar over Trayvon Martin’s death in Florida and his killer’s acquittal.When asked on Friday about racial issues during his end-of-year news conference, Mr. Obama replied, “Like the rest of America, black America in the aggregate is better off now than it was when I came into office.”Mr. Obama has declined to respond directly to African-Americans who have said in recent weeks that they’d like to hear more from him on the topic.“If critics want to suggest that America is inherently and irreducibly racist, then why bother even working on it?” he told reporters on Friday.— Amy ChozickShortly after Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, went for his normal morning workout on Sunday, he told the team of Secret Service agents who protect him that he was staying home for the rest of the day.But as Mr. Johnson watched news accounts of Saturday’s fatal shooting of two New York police officers, he grew convinced that he had to visit the scene. Mr. Johnson was in the perfect location to make such a trip. Unlike weekdays and some weekends, when he is in Washington, Mr. Johnson was at his home in Montclair, N.J.“Ten minutes after I had gotten back into my house, I turned around and told them, ‘I want to go to the scene of the crime today at noon,’ ” Mr. Johnson said in a telephone interview on Sunday night.The car in which the officers were ambushed was no longer there, but makeshift memorials were going up nearby. Mr. Johnson left two sets of roses and said a prayer before heading to the officers’ precinct. It “looks like every single other New York City police station,” he said. “But it had the feel of a family wake.”Inside, he said, there were mountains of food and several of the precinct’s former commanders – some who didn’t even know the men who were killed. “I introduced myself to every officer there,” he said.Mr. Johnson said he had learned the power of such visits firsthand on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks last year when he toured fire and police stations in Lower Manhattan with former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York.“Showing up counts with these officers — just being there,” he said. “There is nothing eloquent you are expected to say, nothing specific you are expected to say. Just showing up matters a lot.”— Michael S. SchmidtTwo of the likely Republican presidential contenders — Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky — continued to have at it on Sunday over President Obama‘s new Cuba policy. Mr. Rubio lashed out with what in party circles may be the ultimate insult, referring to the Cuban overtures, and Mr. Paul’s support of them, as the “Obama-Paul foreign policy.”“If he wants to become the chief cheerleader of Obama’s foreign policy, he certainly has a right to do that,” Mr. Rubio said on the ABC News program “This Week” after absorbing repeated jabs via Twitter on Friday from Mr. Paul, who called him an isolationist.Their sparring raises the question of how much trouble this might create for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who as the incoming majority leader will have to manage the presidential hopes and egos of Mr. Paul and Mr. Rubio and any others who might enter the primary fight.Mr. McConnell, in a recent interview, said he didn’t think he would have a problem.“Ambition in the Senate is not unusual,” said Mr. McConnell, who recently achieved his own personal goal to become majority leader. “We have all kinds of ambition in the Senate for all kinds of things.”— Carl Hulse and Emmarie HuettemanRepublican congressmen who blanketed the morning talk shows on Sunday took President Obama to task over what they said was his weak response to the cyberattack on Sony Pictures. The United States has said it has evidence that North Korea is behind the hacking in retaliation for the Sony release of “The Interview,” a comedy about a far-fetched assassination plot against Kim Jong-un.Senator John McCain, for one, said that it was an act of war and that Mr. Obama should have acknowledged it as such.“The president does not understand that this is a new — this is a manifestation of a new form of warfare,” the Arizona Republican said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, was equally emphatic. “It is an act of terrorism,” he said on the CBS News program “Face the Nation.”Their criticisms provide insight into how the 114th Congress might respond when it convenes in a couple of weeks, with Senator Mark S. Kirk, Republican of Illinois, calling for congressional hearings on the attack, the decision by leading theater chains to pull the movie from their screens and Sony Pictures’ cancellation of its Christmas Day release.— Nick CorasanitiPresident Obama is in Honolulu, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is home in Wilmington, Del.The Permanent Council of the Organization of American States has called a special meeting for 11 a.m. at its Washington headquarters to discuss the changes in United States-Cuba relations. The Joint Inter-American Dialogue/Brookings Institution Latin America Initiative will also discuss the diplomatic breakthrough from 9 to 10:30 a.m.Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, holds a news conference at 9:15 a.m. in Liberia on American efforts to stop Ebola.Independent voters, who were critical to President Obama’s nomination and election in 2008, are now “solidly” Republican-leaning, a party pollster concluded after sifting through November exit polls and his own election-night survey of voters.But Republicans could lose that edge, he warned, if they focus on fighting Mr. Obama rather than on passing legislation after they take control of Congress.“The ideological composition of independents has moved from a leaning center-right group to a solidly center-right group,” David Winston, a strategist for congressional Republicans, wrote in a postelection analysis that is circulating among leaders in both parties.A reason for the shift – other than dissatisfaction with Mr. Obama — is that independents as a group now include Americans who once identified as Republicans but who became disillusioned with the party, Mr. Winston said. They remain conservative but are not as partisan as self-described Republicans, many of whom want congressional Republicans to continue their battles with the president, and some of whom want to proceed with impeachment.“Independents, by a wide margin, want Republicans to concentrate on economic policies over reining in the president,” he wrote.Republicans have won independents for three straight elections since 2008. Two years ago, Mr. Obama lost them by five percentage points, even as he won re-election.— Jackie CalmesThe man who killed the two police officers in New York City had boasted of his plans.Some Republicans worry that the popularity of Ben Carson, a favorite of the party’s most conservative wing, threatens a smooth nominating process in 2016.President Obama may return North Korea to the list of state sponsors of terrorism in retaliation for the hacking at Sony Pictures.Gas prices are down, but public transit ridership is up.President Obama took the Sony Pictures hacking crisis “from bad to worse,” according to Variety.Carl Hiaasen, in The Miami Herald, says there has been an “outbreak of common sense” on Cuba.The Senate Ethics Committee guidelines that have constrained former Senator Jim DeMint, the South Carolina Republican, in his role as Heritage Foundation president are expiring, and he is ready to storm Congress in lobbying for conservative causes, National Journal says.The Washington Post reports that President Obama has selected Sally Quillian Yates, the United States attorney in Atlanta, to be the No. 2 official at the Justice Department.New York magazine has a list, and a slide show, of every guest who sang farewell to Stephen Colbert last week (including Maureen Dowd, Thomas L.

"PhotoGood morning from Washington, where would-be Republican candidates are scrambling for campaign talent, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, speculates about whom he might appoint if he becomes president, Senator Harry Reid says you’d better believe that he is running again in Nevada, and the Israeli elections continue to have political repercussions in the United States. We haven’t forgotten that the Super Bowl is on television this weekend, and neither have some issue advocacy groups.Much of the attention at this early stage of the Republican presidential contest is devoted to donors and their political suitors. But Jeb Bush’s move to hire a former Mitt Romney adviser is a reminder that there is also a fierce competition among the would-be candidates for campaign staff members.Advisers like Mr. Bush’s new strategist, David Kochel, can build the infrastructure for a presidential campaign well before it’s announced. But the embryonic operations are also on the hunt for lawyers, advertising professionals, pollsters, public relations experts and field organizers.It’s a matter of great interest in the gossipy universe of political professionals and reporters — who is signing up with whom? — but it’s more than that. These early hires tell a broader story about which of the likely candidates are considered most viable in the long run by the political professionals.So as we head into an unpredictable Republican race for the 2016 nomination, it helps to follow what could be called the talent primary: Where do the most sought-after operatives go?In conversations with one another and with reporters, these campaign veterans are asking about the strengths and weaknesses of the men and women considering the race, trying to determine where they will devote the next 20 months of their lives.Whether it is donors or staff members, it’s now decision season.— Jonathan MartinWill he or won’t he? That’s what people in political circles are asking about the re-election plans of Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, as he recuperates at his home in Washington from serious injuries suffered in an accident while exercising.Given that he is 75 years old, has just undergone surgery to restore vision in one eye and has seen his party lose the Senate majority, some are betting that Mr. Reid will forego another difficult election in Nevada in the next year.Well, he wants people to rest assured: He is running for re-election, and he cannot say it clearly enough.“All I can say is what I keep saying, I’m running,” Mr. Reid said in an interview on Thursday at his Washington home. “I’m running. And that’s all I can say, O.K.? I’m just saying, I’m running.”Despite his recent absence from the Capitol while tending to his health, Mr. Reid said that he had been deeply engaged in his party’s strategy during the new Congress’ first month and that Democrats were off to a strong start as they adjusted to their new role. And for those worried about his whereabouts, he intends to spend more time on Capitol Hill beginning next week.We will have more from our interview with Mr. Reid later on Friday about both his recovery and how he has turned his home into a congressional office.— Carl HulseAmerican political operatives don’t always restrict their work to elections on their home turf, and many of them are on the job in the run-up to the Israeli elections in March.Jeremy Bird, an Obama campaign veteran, and his consulting group, 270 Strategies, are working with two policy groups in Israel, One Voice and Victory 15. Neither back a specific candidate, but their platforms are not friendly to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.Mr. Bird’s involvement became public just this week, when the Israeli newspaper Hareetz broke the news. Some American officials, like Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican, saw it as evidence that the Obama administration was meddling in foreign elections, especially because One Voice at one point had received State Department financing.Marc Ginsberg, the chief executive of One Voice, said his group’s relationship with 270 Strategies began in October 2013, and Mr. Bird was not involved early on.Americans’ involvement in Israeli politics is nothing new. In 2009, Bill Knapp, a Democratic strategist who worked for the 2008 Obama campaign, was an adviser to Mr. Netanyahu, and Josh Isay, a major-league consultant in New York, Washington and Albany, has worked for him, too.Mark Mellman has advised Yair Lapid, chairman of the Yesh Atid Party and a former Israeli finance minister. And Stanley Greenberg, a veteran of former President Bill Clinton’s campaigns, has worked with Israel’s Labor Party.— Nick CorasanitiNow that Senator Lindsey Graham is pondering a presidential run, is it too early to start thinking about his cabinet lineup?As the garrulous South Carolina Republican was holding court with reporters about the nomination of Loretta E. Lynch as attorney general, he was asked about whom he would name to lead the Justice Department.“Trey Gowdy,” he fired back without a pause, naming the conservative former prosecutor from his home state who is now heading up the House Benghazi investigation.But even as he walked away, Mr. Graham was having second thoughts and said he would name Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire as attorney general. (Ms. Ayotte is a former New Hampshire attorney general who has become an ally of Mr. Graham and Senator John McCain of Arizona.)“I would put Kelly there,” he said, “and put Trey on the Supreme Court.”— Carl HulsePresident Obama will announce a major biomedical research initiative, including plans to collect genetic data on one million Americans so that scientists can develop drugs and treatments tailored to individual patients’ specific characteristics.Secretary of State John Kerry is hosting the North American foreign ministers meeting in Boston.Michelle Obama, the pro-veterans group Got Your 6, and leaders in the film and television industry will announce an effort to expand public understanding of veterans issues.The Commerce Department releases the fourth-quarter gross domestic product data.In between the snaps, tackles and pops, the Super Bowl is all about commercials for beer, chips and trucks. It’s a time when Americans can escape “super PAC” money and issue ads.But not always. The Federal Communications Commission requires network affiliates to set aside a small amount of advertising time for local issues, broadcast at a fraction of the cost that commercial advertisers pay (millions of dollars per minute).In Washington, the American Petroleum Institute is spending $100,000 for a spot that is expected to focus on the Keystone XL pipeline, according to the Sunlight Foundation. The Center for Union Facts will also put up an ad criticizing union tactics, a three-year tradition.In previous Super Bowls, groups like Mayors Against Illegal Guns and the Center for Consumer Freedom have also bought time on Washington stations.Most Super Bowl fans will see few, if any, ads with a political bent.The most recent quasi-political spot to run during the national broadcast was the “It’s Halftime in America” commercial in 2012, which, while celebrating Chrysler’s recovery and lacking any overt political affiliation, angered some Republicans as helping President Obama in an election year.That commercial was narrated by Clint Eastwood — an irony, really, given his infamous anti-Obama speech at the Republican National Convention later that year.— Nick CorasanitiThe Senate passes a bill to force construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is seeking help from congressional Democrats to calm the uproar over his planned speech before Congress in March.In Philadelphia, President Obama tries to rally the House Democrats around the policy agenda he laid out in his State of the Union address.Why didn’t Michelle Obama wear a head scarf during this week’s condolence visit in Saudi Arabia?

"PhotoGood Tuesday morning from a flurried Washington, where a drone that crashed on White House grounds is causing headaches and inspiring Twitter jokes, the House Benghazi committee renews its investigation into the 2012 attacks in Libya, Republicans have pulled their border security bill, and the Obama administration will announce that it is opening the Eastern Seaboard to oil and gas drilling. We start, though, by looking at the political implications of snow.Snowfall can bring political downfall.The most famous victim of a snowmaggedon, snowzilla or snowpocalypse was former Mayor Michael Bilandic of Chicago. His reported mishandling of the blizzard of January 1979 ended his career when he lost the Democratic primary later that year. He even told Chicago magazine that the storm cost him the election.Ten years earlier, a snowstorm that killed 42 people almost drove Mayor John Lindsay of New York out of office. From the Queens Chronicle: “It was a storm that created a political crisis forever etched in the annals of municipal politics and a lesson to all future politicians in the politics of snow removal.”Mr. Lindsay, then a Republican, also lost his primary that year, although he ended up winning re-election on the Liberal-Independent line.New York mayors have taken a particular beating during snowstorms. Last year, Mayor Bill de Blasio was criticized when the streets of the Upper East Side weren’t cleared fast enough. His predecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, was repeatedly blamed for snow-clogged streets in outer boroughs.Here in Washington, former Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. decided to stay on a Super Bowl vacation in California in January 1987 while the city was buried in 26 inches of snow. The Washington City Paper called it the “Blizzard of Indifference.”Mr. de Blasio has gone out of his way to prevent criticism this time around. Even the subways have shut down.And that’s ironic, because it was the Great White Hurricane of 1888 that finally persuaded city leaders that they needed a mass transit system that ran underground where the snow never fell.— Steve KennyThis being the nation’s capital, the White House drone drama is playing out in two ways.There is the round of official hand-wringing about White House security and the need for more regulations about who can operate drones and where they can fly them. Hobbyists are already braced for restrictive new rules. And after one crashed on White House grounds on Monday, many are convinced that the government is now coming for their drones.Twitter was having none of it. President Obama’s more conservative critics were having an especially good time.From Erick Erickson: “Whichever hipster crashed his drone on the White House lawn was at least not so stoned he decided to climb the fence to retrieve it.” And Michelle Malkin: “It wasn’t mine, I swear.” (Ms. Malkin also retweeted a photo of herself holding a drone. The message with it reads: “The Secret Service are rounding up possible suspects for the Quad Copter drone attack on the White House. ;)” )Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. wasn’t getting out of this either. One Photoshopped image of him holding a remote control device was making the retweet rounds with a clever caption suggesting that he was flying the drone.— Michael D. ShearThe House committee organized by Republicans to look into the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, will hold its first hearing of the year on Tuesday morning, previewing what promises to be a contentious year of partisan sniping over what the Obama administration might have done to stop the assault that led to the deaths of four Americans.Democrats are already objecting to how the committee is being run, accusing Republicans of shutting them out of the investigation and preventing them from interviewing witnesses, including people who have contradicted claims of administration wrongdoing.The leading Democrat on the committee, Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, plans to use the hearing to air his grievances. He has already expressed his concerns in a series of letters to the panel’s Republican chairman, Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina. Those letters, obtained by First Draft, outline Democrats’ worry that the investigation has “taken a sharp turn for the worse.”In a letter dated Nov. 24, Mr. Cummings said Mr. Gowdy had assured him “and the American public that this investigation would be different — that it would be run in a transparent and bipartisan manner that the American people could be proud of.”Mr. Cummings went on to say that Democrats had been excluded from at least five witness interviews.In a letter to Mr. Gowdy last week, Mr. Cummings’s irritation grew more apparent: “You have had different standards for Republicans and Democrats participating in the investigation.”Mr. Gowdy, a former prosecutor, has pledged that the panel’s investigation is apolitical. “I want this to transcend politics,” he said last year, acknowledging that many Americans view the numerous and lengthy inquiries into the Benghazi attacks as a partisan assault on President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Monday.— Jeremy W. PetersAnother week, another piece of legislation that was expected to pass easily is pulled from the House floor schedule by Republican leaders.In this case, it was a new border security bill set for a vote on Wednesday that the party decided to delay, saying that the snowstorm snarling travel in the Northeast would make it difficult to survey members for their opinions in time.The action came after Republicans last week had to abandon an anti-abortion bill because of last-minute objections by some of the party’s women and moderates. The border bill was lower profile, but it had its Republican detractors. They feared the measure would allow Republicans to back down in the immigration fight with President Obama by saying they had taken steps to secure the border.“Advancing any immigration measure, even border security, before reining in this lawless president is putting the cart before the horse,” said Michael A. Needham, chief executive of the group Heritage Action.The bill’s supporters say the extra time will allow them to sell the measure to skeptical Republicans.— Carl HulseEven lobbyists appear to be tiring of Congress.A new study by the research firm LegiStorm found that the number of lobbyists who became congressional staff members last year fell to its lowest level in a decade.Just 65 lobbyists walked through what many call Washington’s revolving door. In 2013, 112 lobbyists switched sides.Sheila Krumholz, executive director for the Center for Responsive Politics, said the lower total could mean that fewer lobbyists have been properly registered, making it harder to tell when they join a congressional staff.Ms. Krumholz also suggested that the 2014 dip might be temporary, and that Republican control of both houses of Congress could make legislative work more appealing to lobbyists.The door is still revolving as fast as ever in the reverse direction, with 394 former congressional staff members registering as lobbyists last year.

Love, Dropkick Murphys,” the band wrote on Twitter.It isn’t the first time Dropkick Murphys has made its feelings clear about Mr. Walker. When State Representative Jeff Fitzgerald used “I’m Shipping Up to Boston” at an event in 2012, the band posted an angry note on Facebook saying that a “crony of anti-Union Governor Scott Walker” using a Dropkick Murphys song “is like a white supremacist coming out to gangsta rap!”The year before, when Mr. Walker was locked in a battle with the state’s government-employee unions, the band released a song called “Take ‘Em Down” and a custom T-shirt in support of the unions. Proceeds went to the Workers’ Rights Emergency Response Fund.“The bottom line is when a politician uses our music to walk out to, for better or worse, it brands us with that person,” the bassist Ken Casey said in a statement.It also isn’t Mr. Walker’s first experience with an angry rock star.

"PhotoGood Thursday morning from Washington, where an Obama administration official expresses displeasure with the Israeli ambassador over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plans to address Congress, and Loretta E. Lynch, the attorney general nominee, has an easier time at her confirmation hearing than Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., and he wasn’t even there. House Democrats work on a game plan in Philadelphia while Ralph Reed, the influential conservative, gives Republicans advice on how to improve theirs. And a Mitt Romney speech in Mississippi may have repercussions at a Friday luncheon in Manhattan.House Democrats are to huddle on Thursday night with President Obama at their retreat in Philadelphia, the final 2015 strategy session for the two parties’ Capitol Hill combatants. It’s fitting that the Democrats are up last: Members of the House minority are usually in the toughest position in Congress.Senate Democrats are also now in the minority, but they can employ the filibuster and other procedural weapons to make their voices heard. But in the House, where the Republicans just increased their numbers, the majority really does rule, making it hard for Democrats to break through.And they see a very steep climb back to the majority in November 2016.House Democrats said they would use the Philadelphia meeting to rally the rank and file with a message that they will push for middle-class tax breaks. They’ve also scheduled a session on trade, an issue that may turn into a point of contention with Mr. Obama. Another seminar is called “We Are in This Together,” a reminder that the overall cause will suffer if the party breaks into factions.Before the retreat ends on Friday with a speech by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., there is a final session called “Where Do We Go From Here?” led by Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the former speaker and current leader of the House Democrats. It’s a question a lot of them are asking and would no doubt like to hear answered.— Carl HulseWith nearly a billion dollars of Koch money set to be poured into Republican campaigns through 2016, it would be only natural for other conservative power brokers to fret about being sidelined.But the leader of one influential group of evangelical Christians warns that if Republicans overlook social conservatives, they do so at their peril.“I don’t think any Republican presidential aspirant is going to be able to win the nomination or the White House without having a laserlike focus on maximizing the turnout of faith-based voters in 2016,” Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, told First Draft.Mr. Reed said that although the “novelty” of evangelical voters had waned in the last decade, their power as a voting bloc had not. His group has targeted more than 30 million potential voters across the United States and is preparing to spend twice as much as it did in the 2014 elections to mobilize them.As a way to track down new voters, the Faith and Freedom Coalition is buying data about online shoppers who are looking for Bibles and religious literature.Although business-friendly and deep-pocketed donors like Charles G. and David H. Koch and groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce might not put a priority on laws to restrict abortion or ban same-sex marriage, Mr. Reed said they should not overlook the intensity of evangelical influence at the polls.“You’re not going to get your tax cut if this vote doesn’t turn out,” he said. “If evangelicals don’t pour out of the pews and into the voting precincts, there isn’t going to be any successful business agenda.”— Alan RappeportThe event, conceived of weeks ago, was to be the picture of bipartisanship: members of the Romney and Clinton clans, sitting side by side at a luncheon in Manhattan.But Friday’s hush-hush event — featuring Ann and Mitt Romney as well as Chelsea Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky — just got a little awkward.On Wednesday night, Mr. Romney directed several harsh, partisan-minded jabs at Ms. Clinton’s mother, Hillary Rodham Clinton, during a speech in Mississippi.Mr. Romney called the former secretary of state “clueless” in her approach to Russia and ignorant of how the American economy works.“How can Secretary Clinton provide opportunity for all if she doesn’t know where jobs come from in the first place?” Mr. Romney asked in his address at Mississippi State University.That should give the two families something to discuss at Friday’s event, which is intended to draw attention to the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.Mr. Mezvinsky is on the center’s board, as is Spencer Zwick, a Romney family friend, who is also expected at the lunch.— Michael BarbaroPresident Obama keynotes the House Democratic caucus retreat in Philadelphia.Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, is scheduled to give a “major address” on the state of the nation’s safety at 10 a.m.Attorney General Eric H.

Lynch. Republicans used it as another chance to take shots at the current attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., before he leaves office.Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, regaled Ms. Lynch with the tale of the “corrupt” prosecution of his old colleague, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska. Mr. Stevens, a Senate powerhouse, was defeated in 2008 after being convicted of felony charges of failing to report gifts. The guilty verdict was voided a few months later when it was revealed that prosecutors had withheld evidence. Mr. Stevens died in a plane crash two years later.“You have a lot of work to do to clean up the department,” Mr. Hatch told Ms. Lynch.Tired of the Holder bashing, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, noted one problem with Mr. Hatch’s example: The Stevens prosecution was brought under the administration of President George W. Bush.

"PhotoGood Wednesday morning from Washington, where Loretta E. Lynch has to prove to the Senate Judiciary Committee that she’s no Eric H. Holder Jr., and Speaker John A. Boehner admits that his leadership team has suffered surprises in the first month of the new Congress. We look at the significance of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s recent retreat from the spotlight. And the turmoil continues in Albany, where the embattled Sheldon Silver is suddenly no longer the Assembly speaker.Loretta E. Lynch faces the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday as the panel considers her nomination for attorney general. But the proceedings might be as much about Eric H. Holder Jr., the man she would replace, as Ms. Lynch herself.Republican anger at Mr. Holder runs deep, and lawmakers seem determined to make Ms. Lynch, a career prosecutor, prove that she is the anti-Holder. They especially want to be assured that she won’t intrude in political affairs, as they say Mr. Holder has often done, or show disdain for Congress.“The Justice Department has devolved into being more political than it should be,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said. “The next person has to clean this mess up.”On Thursday, the second day of hearings, Republicans have summoned witnesses to address what amounts to a greatest hits of their grievances against Mr. Holder. The testimony will address the gun-running operation Fast and Furious, voter identification laws and the Internal Revenue Service scrutiny of conservative groups. Mr. Holder appears to be in for one last bashing on Capitol Hill.It might not trouble him much. The attorney general has pledged to stay in the job until a replacement is approved. If Ms. Lynch can win confirmation, even at Mr. Holder’s expense, it will free him to step aside.— Carl HulseWhat’s that we hear from Hillary Rodham Clinton’s camp? That’s right — nothing.Her normally chatty circle of advisers is being exceptionally quiet as she builds a campaign team and drafts a unified message before a likely 2016 run for the presidency.Mrs. Clinton — who had a characteristically hectic schedule since leaving the secretary of state’s office in 2013 — has herself been keeping a low profile in anticipation of an expected campaign announcement, most likely in April.She has lined up two paid speeches in the coming months: the keynote address at the Watermark Silicon Valley Conference for Women and a talk to summer-camp professionals in Atlantic City.Mrs. Clinton is also set to speak in Washington on March 23 when the Toner Prize — named in honor of Robin Toner, the first woman to be The New York Times’s national political correspondent, who died in 2008 — is handed out.“She is a vivid example, like Robin, of a pioneering woman at the top of her profession,” Lorraine Branham, the dean of the Newhouse School at Syracuse University, which sponsors the Toner Prize.Ready for Hillary, the “super PAC” that has been drumming up support for Mrs. Clinton, has been on a fund-raising blitz, including events in London and New York, before it is to close up shop to make way to an official campaign.It’s also a critical time for the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, whose donors may shift their focus to a Clinton campaign.The foundation, which has built up an endowment worth roughly $250 million, will hold its annual gala in New York on March 4 with a special performance by Carole King.— Amy ChozickSpeaker John A. Boehner was candid on Tuesday in admitting that House Republicans have “had a couple of stumbles” out of the gate this year while trying to show the strength of the party’s new majority on Capitol Hill.Bills to restrict abortions and bolster border security — issues usually heartily embraced by House Republicans — have been tabled after support wavered. Many Republicans admit privately that it was a political mistake to approve a Homeland Security bill amendment ending deportation protection for immigrants living in the country illegally who were brought over as children.Republicans say they were caught off guard by the opposition to the abortion and border security bills, which had been approved easily in the past. But it’s evidence of how quickly the political atmosphere can shift.It is also a reminder that Mr. Boehner’s leadership team is relatively new and is learning on the job.— Carl HulseJeb Bush was famously addicted to his BlackBerry when he was Florida’s governor, so much so that he included his smartphone in his official portrait.“It was a symbol of how I worked,” Mr. Bush said in 2008. “I received 550,000 personal e-mails when I was governor.”But at a recent event in San Francisco, First Draft noticed that Mr. Bush appeared to be sporting a Pebble smartwatch on his wrist. Slick and stylish, it is popular among tech workers but is not officially compatible with (what’s left of) modern BlackBerrys.So we decided to investigate. Turns out Mr. Bush ditched his beloved BlackBerry a few years back for an iPhone.Mr. Bush has been embracing social media as he prepares for 2016 and a likely presidential campaign, so his switch over to the app-friendly iPhone isn’t a surprise.Still, as far as we know, an iPhone has never made it into any official government portrait.— Nick CorasanitiPresident Obama is back from Saudi Arabia and will host an Armed Forces Farewell tribute for Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel.The Senate is holding hearings on the budget, cybersecurity and efforts to protect senior citizens from marketing scams.Gov.

Now as a cultural ambassador of sorts, he proved to be one of the most head-turning members of the president’s delegation, recognized almost everywhere he went in New Delhi.He filmed a two-and-a-half-minute video for the White House website about Mr. Obama’s visit, complete with a cartoon from Indian television showing Mr. Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi dancing. Mr. Penn also posted photos to his personal Instagram account, including a selfie with Mr. Modi and a food shot from a restaurant.“All in all, a really busy week for President Obama here in India,” Mr. Penn said in the video.

"PhotoGood Wednesday morning from Washington, where Republicans will seek to land the first blow in their immigration fight with President Obama, Speaker John A. Boehner gives the president a friendly lecture on his expectations, and a new study shows the steadily growing power of “super PACs.” Plus, we look in on the United States ambassador to France after the Paris unity rally and go inside the nascent presidential campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton.The House is set to vote on Wednesday on a bill that would invalidate President Obama‘s executive action on immigration, but the fight is just beginning.Congressional leaders know the nearly $40 billion measure — which would pay for most Homeland Security operations, but not any immigration initiatives — cannot pass the Senate if it reverses the president’s move. And even if it could pass, Mr. Obama would veto it.Congressional Republicans also know that they cannot afford to be held responsible for allowing money for the Department of Homeland Security to run out because of their outrage over immigration, particularly with the nation’s nerves on edge after the terrorist attacks in France. So the vote is just the first move in a politically charged chess match.It provides an opportunity for Republicans to again register their opposition to Mr. Obama’s immigration policies even if they have to give ground later to make sure the nation’s border agency does not get caught in a financing squeeze.“Our goal here is to fund the Department of Homeland Security,” Speaker John A. Boehner said. “And our second goal is to stop the president’s executive overreach.”That’s a tacit admission that agency operations will take precedence over efforts to undermine immigration policy.— Carl HulseRepublican leaders joined their Democratic counterparts at the White House on Tuesday for their first meeting with President Obama since Republicans took control of the Senate. By almost all accounts, it ended on a positive note.The president and Republicans agreed they might be able to cooperate on trade, and Mr. Obama said he would propose a resolution authorizing the fight against the Islamic State.Naturally, there were a few small issues. According to an account provided by Speaker John A. Boehner’s office, the speaker urged the president against vetoing the Keystone XL pipeline bill, advised him that the House was moving to stop his unilateral action on immigration and reminded him that he had said, many times, that he lacked the power to take unilateral action.Imagine what the negative meetings are like.— Carl HulseIt was seen as an insult to the world and an offense to the French people: The American representative at the Paris unity on march on Sunday was the lowly ambassador in Paris.It may have been the first time in Jane D. Hartley’s adult life that she was so taken for granted.But the day after the march, the White House decided that Ms. Hartley — a former Carter administration staff member turned chief executive of an international economic and political consulting firm, a woman whose art-adorned Park Avenue apartment served as President Obama’s fund-raising flagship in New York — lacked a certain je ne sais quoi.“It’s fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile to be there,” said Josh Earnest, the White House spokesman.Through no fault of her own, Ms. Hartley, who is married to Ralph Schlosstein, the BlackRock co-founder and now chief executive of Evercore Partners, became the elegant center of Washington’s latest outrage storm as the news media and administration critics took offense that President Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. (who was in Paris) skipped the march.Recently appointed, and unknown to most people outside Washington and Manhattan’s exclusive donor circles, Ms. Hartley became — per The Washington Times — an “ambassadonor” whose marching showed that “America’s oldest ally deserves more than a campaign fund-raiser.”Ms. Hartley did not return a request for comment, but she addressed the issue on Monday when asked about the diplomatic misstep by CNN.She said she had spoken to President François Hollande of France before the rally, “and he was so positive about the U.S.”Asked specifically if she had conveyed an apology over Mr. Obama’s absence, she said “no” and then watched warily as the reporter asked if the issue, as far as she was concerned, was over.“Well,” she said. “It’s not my issue.”— Jason HorowitzOutside spending has exploded in the three federal election cycles since the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court, according to a new study, with independent expenditures exceeding candidate spending in many competitive Senate elections.The report, to be released on Wednesday by the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning research group that favors tighter regulation of political spending, also shows that a relatively small number of donors have provided most of the money being spent by outside groups. Sixty percent of the money — more than $600 million — spent by so-called super PACs since 2010 was contributed by fewer than 200 donors and their spouses, the study found.“These facts belie past claims of super PAC apologists who have painted them as good for democracy because they allow citizens to pool limited resources,” Ian Vandewalker, a Brennan Center counsel, writes in the report.The research underscores the rapid growth of independent spending since the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision, which paved the way for wealthy individuals, corporations and unions to pool unlimited contributions in big-spending PACs. While total independent spending represents a relatively small chunk of all reported political spending, it is heavily concentrated in the most competitive elections.The rise of outside groups, the report concludes, has diminished the importance of fund-raising limits that still bind candidates and parties.And the figures may underestimate the full scale of outside spending: Political nonprofit groups, the other major source of independent spending, do not have to disclose their donors or report expenditures on “issue ads” that do not expressly call for the election or defeat of a candidate.— Nick ConfessorePresident Obama travels to Cedar Falls, Iowa, to lay out a plan for high-speed broadband across the country.The House will vote on the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, which would block President Obama’s executive action on immigration.Eight groups will jointly release research on the role of money in the 2014 midterm elections, with particular emphasis on the effects of the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court.

That beat expectations. Then forecasters increased their numbers for the final three months of 2014 after the government reported higher export totals than expected and lower imports, led by record declines in imported oil.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the new majority leader, hinted at a new Republican approach in proclaiming on the Senate floor that “the uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama administration’s long tenure in Washington: the expectation of a new Republican Congress.”Well, maybe. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, the new Finance Committee chairman, stuck to the old script when he released a compendium of woes: Low participation in the labor force, little change in the percentage of the population actually employed, slow wage growth and falling median income. Oh, and record debt.Still, the job totals released on Friday will almost certainly show that 2014 had higher employment gains than any year since 1999.The conservative economics writer James Pethokoukis might have summed up the predicament in an essay published in The Week: “The G.O.P. said Obamanomics would kill the economy. It didn’t. Now what?”— Jonathan WeismanThe actor George Clooney, former Senator Scott P. Brown of Massachusetts and the billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer now have one thing in common. They are all in the conversation about who might take a shot at filling Senator Barbara Boxer’s California seat in 2016. (She announced on Thursday that she wouldn’t be running again.)All it will take is a little money. Well, maybe a lot of money. “You’re talking about tens of millions of dollars,” said Stuart Rothenberg, editor of The Rothenberg Political Report. And that’s just for a primary.The sum could double, he suggested, if a well-financed executive or entrepreneur jumps in on the Republican side. In 2010, Ms. Boxer spent nearly $30 million to defeat Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard, who spent $22 million herself.“It’s a glamour state, and I’m sure it will be enticing to people who have significant personal wealth,” Mr. Rothenberg said. There hasn’t been an open Senate seat in California since 1992, and there is likely to be a long line of would-be candidates who have been waiting their turn.Jennifer Duffy of the Cook Political Report said spending on the Boxer seat would easily outpace the $118 million total in last year’s North Carolina race — the costliest Senate battle of 2014.“California is a bottomless pit for money in a statewide contest,” Ms. Duffy said. “There is never too much, but there is easily too little.”— Alan RappeportFirst Draft obtained an early copy of former Gov. Mike Huckabee’s latest book, “Guns, God, Grits and Gravy,” and let’s just say that it isn’t the bland description of policy and life story offered up by so many would-be presidents.Here’s the title of Chapter 10: “Bend Over and Take It Like a Prisoner!” That’s the part where Mr. Huckabee lashes out at the Transportation Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the Patriot Act and people who don’t know how to buckle a seat belt (they “shouldn’t be allowed to fly”).There are colorful anecdotes and allusions that explain his conservative principles. Same-sex marriage? “One has to be more imaginative than Pixar to claim that the Bible approves of homosexual behavior.” And Chapter 2’s title is a simple statement about “Guns and Why We Have Them.”He spends a lot of time dissecting the “Culture of Crude” (Chapter 4’s title). He takes on Miley Cyrus at the MTV Video Music Awards (“a disgustingly pornographic performance that showed just about everything she had – except talent”) as well as Jay Z and Beyoncé (“Does it occur to him that he is arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object?”).He also spends an entire chapter on the “Dumpster-diving, snuff-dipping, knuckle-dragging dopes” of reality television — but not those on “Duck Dynasty.”The book’s overarching theme is personal freedom, or “Get Off My Lawn,” as Chapter 9’s title puts it.— Nick CorasanitiThe Iowa Republican Party’s straw poll is likely to take place again this summer.Many prominent Iowa Republicans, including Gov. Terry E. Branstad, had indicated they wanted to end the quadrennial tradition in Ames. But the state party’s governing board is poised re-authorize what has become a lucrative fund-raiser for the party.Party leaders were worried that the straw poll might interfere with its coveted caucuses, the first contest of every presidential year. But on Thursday, the Republican National Committee issued an advisory that “the straw poll has absolutely no bearing on the official presidential nomination process.”Former Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota won the straw poll in 2011, only to come last in the caucuses early the next year. And former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota dropped out after his poor showing. Mr. Branstad and others hoped those results would lead many candidates to bypass the straw poll, signifying the end of the long-running summer event.“You could do an event but not have a poll and still give candidates to speak to a crowd,” Mr. Branstad said in an interview last month.But some Iowa Republicans feared a conservative group would step in with a poll of its own that would draw attention and money that would otherwise go to the state party.— Jonathan MartinPresident Obama is in Knoxville, Tenn., to announce his ambitious proposal to provide a tuition-free education for millions of community college students.

"PhotoGood Monday morning from Washington, where questions have followed President Obama and Congress back to town. Can the president work with the Republican majorities? And can Republicans take advantage of the power they hold to pass the legislation they want? With Mike Huckabee giving up his Fox show, another contestant has joined the presidential guessing game. And we remember the lives of former Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and former Senator Edward W. Brooke III of Massachusetts.The 114th Congress convenes this week, and Republicans will rule the roost for the first time since 2006, with potent majorities in both the House and the Senate.Now the big question: Can the party’s leadership hold fractious lawmakers together to effectively exert their new power?The first test comes on Tuesday when Speaker John A. Boehner faces a rebellion of sorts, with a handful of very conservative Republicans declaring that they will not support him for speaker. Representatives Louie Gohmert of Texas and Ted Yoho of Florida have put themselves forward as alternatives.Don’t get too caught up in the idea of a Speaker Yoho or a Speaker Gohmert. With his expanded 246-seat majority in the House, Mr. Boehner has a nice cushion and would have to be abandoned by 29 Republicans for his title to be in jeopardy. His allies consider that highly unlikely.Still, the threat highlights the difficulty Mr. Boehner faces in assembling a working majority without at least some Democratic help. It also reflects the changing nature of Congress. Few lawmakers of the past would dare stray on such a party-loyalty vote and risk the wrath of the leadership. But today,they would rather register their objections and pay the price than stay silent.Once they get through the pomp and celebration of opening day, House and Senate Republicans will turn to approving the Keystone XL pipeline, a measure they are confident they can get to the president’s desk.Things get a little trickier after that, considering party divisions over what to do about health care, the push for a balanced budget and the multiple other big-ticket issues that await.— Carl HulseSo begins one of the more peculiar periods in politics, where White House hopefuls start running for the presidency without saying plainly that they are doing so.Former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida kicked off the pre-primary season last month by writing on Facebook that he was “actively exploring” a bid, and Mike Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, threw his hat in the vicinity of the ring by announcing on his Fox talk show on Saturday that he was ending the program because he could not rule out the possibility of running.Some of this is an authentic testing of the waters. Yet it also ritual. Would-be candidates typically want to get through the holidays and the State of the Union address before formally declaring.A candidate could officially arise in the next few weeks. But for now, it seems likely that when a group of Republicans land in Iowa this month for a forum sponsored by Representative Steve King, each one will be there only as a potential candidate. That at least six are showing up for a single event in Iowa, more than a year before the presidential kickoff take place there, highlights a truism: The time and tides of Iowa’s caucuses wait for no man.— Jonathan MartinMario Cuomo was his own favorite interlocutor.I had sent him some hypothetical questions a year ago to suggest the gist of a video interview that would appear on NYTimes.com only after his death.

The departing majority leader presided over two of the least productive congressional sessions in modern history. In November, voter dissatisfaction left Democrats beaten badly at the polls, relegating Mr. Reid of Nevada to minority leader — a defeat that will make his re-election bid in 2016 more challenging.(There was a bright spot near 2014’s end. He used the lame-duck Congress to usher through many of President Obama’s nominees to confirmation while Democrats still had the majority.)Then on New Year’s Day, Mr. Reid took a tumble while exercising, leaving him with broken facial bones and cracked ribs.Despite the fall, Mr. Reid, a former amateur boxer, will not be resting for long. He is scheduled to be back in Washington for the opening round of another Congress on Tuesday.— Alan RappeportThe Times was succinct in October 1966 in asking one of the biggest questions of that year’s congressional elections:“Will the voters of an old, poorly governed yet occasionally sophisticated state become the first to choose a Negro for their United States senator in anything that could be remotely referred to as modern political history?”The answer was yes, and Edward W. Brooke III, a liberal Republican — at a time when there was such a thing — went on to serve two terms as a senator from Massachusetts. By the time of his death on Saturday at age 95, his groundbreaking role in American politics (The Times called his candidacy “experimental”) had been overshadowed by, among other things, the election of a black president.The 1966 election wasn’t the first time Mr. Brooke had been a political pioneer. Four years earlier, he had been the first African-American to be elected attorney general of any state, a development that President John F. Kennedy called “the biggest news of the country.”Still, that attention sometimes rankled. The Times’s Douglas Martin, in his obituary of Mr. Brooke, wrote that the former senator “grew tired of being called ‘first this, first that.’”Like it or not, Mr. Brooke made history. And his role as the first black senator in the post-Reconstruction era was always going to lead his obit.— Steve KennyPresident Obama’s first day of business after his return to Washington from his Christmas vacation.The Association of American Law Schools annual meeting in Washington, where Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Anita Hill are scheduled to speak.The trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, accused of bombing the Boston Marathon in 2013, which is scheduled to start in Boston.A two-week vacation can, at the beginning, seem like forever.

Plus there was a little time to drop in on a rock star.It became frenetic at 3 p.m. when Mr. Obama took his daughters, Malia and Sasha, to the cemetery where his maternal grandfather is buried. Less than 10 minutes later, they were back in the motorcade to visit the president’s half sister, Maya Soetoro-Ng. Along the way, they passed the Punahou School, which Mr. Obama attended from the 5th through the 12th grades.Twenty minutes later, the president was on the road again, headed to the home of the Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder.The White House would initially only say that “the president and Sasha and Malia Obama are visiting friend Eddie Vedder and family,” but did not clarify whether it was the rock star or just some guy who happened to have the same name. But after a little prodding, the White House clarified.On the way to Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam for the flight to Washington, the first family stopped at Buzz’s Lanikai, a steak restaurant that serves lamb, ribs and crab legs and features a salad bar loaded with avocados and pineapples.By 9:30 p.m., they were making their way down the receiving line at the base.

"PhotoGood Tuesday morning from Washington, where members of Congress, staff members on the Hill and White House aides are preparing for President Obama’s State of the Union address at 9 p.m.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada is expected back in the Senate for the first time since his exercise accident on Jan. 1, but he isn’t expected to stick around for the address. Nielsen predicts viewership nationwide will be low, but Stephen Colbert shares with us his idea on how to fix that.President Obama will deliver his first State of the Union address to a Republican-controlled Congress on Tuesday night, but his newly empowered adversaries have already reached a verdict on some of the initiatives it will outline: They don’t like them.The tax, education and workplace proposals that the president has wheeled out in recent days have landed with a thud among Republicans.The tax overhaul plan made public on Saturday has come under a particularly harsh attack from Republicans who had seen broad tax changes as one possible area of compromise. The plan would raise more than $300 billion over 10 years through new taxes on the wealthy and banking charges. The resulting revenue would be spent on a series of middle-class tax breaks and on a plan to provide a tuition-free community college education.Republicans opposed to anything that even looks like a tax increase declared the proposal dead. The tuition plan, at a cost of $60 billion, also seems unlikely to get much Republican support, at least in the form proposed by the president.But the White House might not care. The president, whose approval numbers are improving, seems to be getting credit for his ideas, and they help his reputation as a politician who wants to do something to close the income gap.The proposals could lead to talks between Democrats and Republicans on taxes and education. If not, Democrats will seize on Republican resistance as evidence that the congressional majority remains loyal to the most affluent Americans despite its claim to be looking out for middle America.— Carl HulseThe State of the Union address was once the Super Bowl of presidential speeches. But how many will tune in — or tune out — on Tuesday night?If the predictions from Nielsen are any guide, President Obama could be addressing the smallest State of the Union audience in recent history.Last year, 33.3 million people watched the speech, according to Nielsen. It was the smallest audience since President Bill Clinton’s address in 2000.The numbers show that State of the Union speeches tend to generate the most interest, and viewership, in times of crisis — hence the higher numbers during the war years of George W. Bush’s time in office or during Mr. Clinton’s infidelity troubles — or at the beginning of a presidency. Mr. Obama’s addresses have seen a steady decline in viewers since the first one drew 52.3 million viewers.So-called Obama fatigue may be one reason for the shrinking numbers. But they may also reflect the decline in broadcast network viewership over all.Acknowledging the changing media landscape, the White House has signaled what Mr. Obama will say in the speech, and it is using social media to get those messages out before the president delivers the speech.It’s not a new strategy. President Harry S. Truman also took advantage of the latest technology in 1947 when he gave the first televised State of the Union address.— Alan RappeportSenator Harry Reid is scheduled to make his return to the Senate Tuesday after a home exercise accident that has kept him away from Capitol Hill since the start of the 114th Congress.Aides say Mr. Reid is to meet with colleagues and attend the weekly Democratic lunch, but that the extent of his activities will be determined by how well he feels and what is transpiring in the Senate. He is not expected to remain for the State of the Union speech.Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, has been handling matters on the floor. But allies say that Mr. Reid has been in regular contact and that he has been calling the shots while recuperating at home.With tough legislative fights ahead, and Mr. Reid gearing up for his own re-election in 2016, his allies would welcome seeing him recovered and back in the office.— Carl HulseSenate Republicans continue to struggle with their pre-election promise to return to Senate traditions.One example: Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, took procedural steps on Friday to bring the new House-passed Homeland Security financing bill directly to the floor despite the frequent pledges to route all legislation through the relevant committees.A spokesman said Mr. McConnell was moving quickly to beat a financing deadline next month and hadn’t made any final decisions on the process. But Democrats quickly pounced.“Senator McConnell’s broken pledges are piling up so fast it’s hard to keep track, but don’t worry, we will give it our best shot,” said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader.Republicans say they will try to pass the Homeland Security measure despite House provisions that block President Obama‘s new immigration policy and end a program that protects immigrants brought into the United States as small children from deportation. Those provisions make it impossible to pass the bill in the Senate, meaning Republicans will need more time to find a compromise.— Carl HulseHave we mentioned that President Obama’s State of the Union address is Tuesday night at 9?

Mr. Keenan, 34, and Mr. Colbert, 50 — both graduates of Northwestern University — have become friendly in recent years. When Mr. Colbert was in Washington last year to host the Kennedy Center Honors, he said he and Mr. Keenan went out for “one or five large and delicious Old Fashioneds.”Mr. Keenan occasionally sends jokes he writes for the president’s speeches seeking Mr. Colbert’s help improving them. “I said to him, ‘Why are you sending me these jokes?’ ” Mr. Colbert said.— Michael S.

"PhotoGood Wednesday morning from Washington on the day after a State of the Union speech that has Republicans shaking their heads and lamenting a lost opportunity for cooperation. We use the occasion to look at how President Bill Clinton handled a similar situation in 1995 and what President Obama didn’t say this year. And this may be a first: The White House uses fashion to push its political message.Washington will try to get back to business on Wednesday after a State of the Union address that found a confident and relaxed President Obama delivering a speech that seemed to leave the new Republican majority in Congress genuinely perplexed.After their resounding election victory just two months ago, Republicans had hoped to hear the president say he had gotten the message and was willing to find common cause. What they got was a sharp reminder that he had twice won the presidency, veto threats and a call to embrace a series of government initiatives that Republicans are not inclined to support (except for new trade deals).He made no mention of their congressional ascendancy.“He hasn’t adjusted to the new reality at all,” said Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a moderate Republican who is usually considered a candidate for cooperation with the Democrats.Republicans did not interpret the president’s jabs at their positions on the minimum wage, climate change and Cuba — interspersed with calls for compromise — as a hopeful sign. “He’s not looking for cooperation,” said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming.Democrats said they found the speech and the president’s attitude refreshing. “It was almost joyful,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.That was not the word Republicans had in mind.— Carl HulsePresident Obama‘s decision on Tuesday night to ignore the Republicans’ election victory and the party’s new majority in the Senate was notable. It also raised the question of how former President Bill Clinton handled a similar situation in January 1995 after Democrats were trounced in the midterm elections and Republicans took back the House for the first time in 40 years.He certainly didn’t avoid it. Mr. Clinton wasted no time in noting that “once again our democracy has spoken.”“So let me begin,” he said, “by congratulating all of you here in the 104th Congress and congratulating you, Mr. Speaker.” That was, of course, Newt Gingrich.But, like Mr. Obama, Mr. Clinton also made sure to point out that he’d had his own big election victory in 1992.“If we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and 1994,” he said. “And as I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992.”— Carl HulsePresident Obama’s speech was more than 6,500 words long. And almost none of them were about entitlement programs.The question of what to do to secure the future of Medicare and Social Security has been a staple of State of the Union speeches by presidents of both parties for decades. Just two years ago, Mr. Obama called on Congress to embrace overhauls of both social safety nets.“Those of us who care deeply about programs like Medicare must embrace the need for modest reforms,” he said at the time. “Otherwise, our retirement programs will crowd out the investments we need for our children, and jeopardize the promise of a secure retirement for future generations.”There was none of that last night. He noted the history of the programs and acknowledged that Americans had “set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity.” He didn’t discuss their future.If the omission was intentional, Republicans say it was also a missed opportunity. Afterward, from the Senate floor, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the new majority leader, called on Mr. Obama to “reach across the aisle to allow us to save and strengthen Medicare.”“Cooperate with both parties to save Social Security,” he urged, adding that Mr. Obama had the chance to “pursue an achievement that history will remember.”That’s unlikely to happen in the two years Mr. Obama has left in office. He suggested on Tuesday that he was more interested in finding ways to improve government services for middle-income Americans. Trimming the social safety net is not on that agenda.— Michael D. ShearFormer Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida has publicly criticized Mitt Romney‘s 2012 presidential campaign in recent weeks. But with Mr. Romney now openly considering another presidential run — and with Mr. Bush doing the same — he is toning down his language.Mr. Bush, in a Washington meeting with lobbyists on Tuesday, responded to a question about Mr. Romney by saying that had the former Massachusetts governor defeated President Obama, the country would have been better off, according to two people at the gathering.His assessment of Mr. Romney was not entirely upbeat. Mr. Bush noted that Mr. Romney’s aptitude for political campaigning did not match his qualities as an executive.— Jonathan MartinPresident Obama travels to Boise State University in Idaho to sell the policies he outlined in the State of the Union speech. It will be his first visit as president to the Republican state.Jacob J. Lew, the Treasury secretary, talks about the state of the economy at the Hutchins Center for Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution.The Senate Foreign Relations Committee holds a hearing on the Iran nuclear negotiations.The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will discuss the effectiveness of the No Child Left Behind initiative.Brent Scowcroft and Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, both former national security advisers, will testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee about the latest challenges facing the United States.Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, talks to the Ripon Society about the State of the Union speech and the Senate agenda for the rest of the year.In the end, President Obama didn’t wear his infamous tan suit: He opted for dark gray, with a white shirt and silver tie.But the fact that the White House used last August’s sartorial snafu to generate Twitter traffic (#YesWeTan) before Tuesday’s State of the Union speech should put to rest any doubt that his aides consider style a useful communication tool. #YesTheyDo.The overarching theme of the speech was neatly mirrored by the visually strong state of the president’s own union: united in grey with Michelle Obama, who wore a tweed Michael Kors suit (her first-ever suit at a State of the Union address) with a black zipper that matched her husband’s color choices almost exactly.Get it? Forget red and blue. Time to turn the page.But has the rest of Washington caught on to the new look?Judging by the flashes of traditional look-at-me periwinkle and crimson sprinkled throughout the House chamber, not entirely — though Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Speaker John A. Boehner demonstrated their own kind of understanding, at least in their ties: indigo and pink stripes (Mr. Biden) and lavender (Mr. Boehner). The knots, however, did seem to skew in opposite directions.But it was Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa — charged with the Republican rebuttal — who really rose to the challenge.

"PhotoGood Monday morning from Washington, where President Obama is under fire by conservatives because he did not attend the antiterrorism unity march in Paris, Republicans are moving quickly to set the tone in a Congress they control, and several Democrats appear ready to buck their party’s leadership. A Yale study finds that Republicans are sharply split over climate change and what to do about it. And Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin schools Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis.It was a photograph printed, broadcast and tweeted around the globe: The front line of Sunday’s Paris unity march. There was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority. Between them were the French president, the German chancellor and the leader of Mali, arm in arm.Glaringly missing were President Obama, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. or Secretary of State John Kerry.Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for an antiterorrism meeting, but he didn’t march. The United States ambassador, Jane D. Hartley, did march, but her presence was not widely noted in a crowd of more than a million people that included 40 world leaders.“Not an excuse in universe can explain why US failed to send to Paris a more visible rep. than Holder. MIAs BHO/Mrs BHO/Kerry/Biden,” tweeted Aaron David Miller, a former State Department official who has worked for both Democratic and Republican administrations.Conservatives were uniformly brutal, as expected, with some snidely pointing out that Mr. Obama did make room on his schedule to meet the N.B.A. champions, the San Antonio Spurs, at the White House on Monday.The White House declined to say whether Mr. Obama or Mr. Biden had considered marching. One administration official noted that the president had issued several public statements about the terrorist attacks, made a condolence trip to the French Embassy in Washington and had spoken on the phone with President François Hollande of France.A senior State Department official said that Mr. Kerry couldn’t attend because he was in India meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a trip that had long been scheduled. However, Mr. Kerry said on Monday that he would fly to Paris this week in a gesture of support for the French government.On CNN, Fareed Zakaria took a nuanced view of what he said was a White House mistake. The absence in Paris of a high-ranking American leader, he said, highlighted that the fight against Islamic terrorism is “not all about America.”— Michael D. Shear and Steve KennyThe new Republican Congress will challenge President Obama on two fronts this week. The Senate is taking up its Keystone XL pipeline measure, and the House will consider a Homeland Security spending bill that Republicans intend to use to thwart the administration’s immigration efforts.With the Department of Homeland Security operating under a spending plan that expires Feb. 27, the Appropriations Committee rolled out a $40 billion bill on Friday that would finance border control, law enforcement and antiterrorism efforts. House Republicans are expected to add a series of amendments that would not only deny funding to carry out the president’s executive order on immigration but take aim at some of the earlier White House efforts to tackle the issue.There is a good reason that the House, which typically waits until the last minute on spending fights, is moving so quickly and so aggressively. The Republican leadership wants its most conservative members to see that the legislation they favor cannot clear the Senate. So by starting early, they preserve time to go back and find a different approach before the money runs out. Both House and Senate leaders have said they would not allow funding for the agency to lapse in the aftermath of the Paris attacks.The Senate is to begin its Keystone debate on Monday, but it is not expected to get to a final vote on the measure until next week. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has said he will allow senators a chance to amend the bill, and House and Senate Republicans are scheduled to leave on Wednesday for a joint retreat in Hershey, Pa.— Carl HulseListening to Republican leaders, you’d think that party members across the board question or deny a human link to global warming.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the new majority leader, has made it a priority to block, delay and deny funds to President Obama’s climate change regulations. In 2012, every Republican presidential candidate but one – former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah – questioned or denied the science of climate change. In the last year’s elections, many Republicans chose to dodge the issue with a simple phrase: “I’m not a scientist.”But Republican voters are deeply divided on the issue, according to a survey analysis out on Monday from the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. It found that 56 percent of all Republicans support regulating planet-warming carbon pollution. The divide is more apparent when Republicans are asked to define their ideology: 62 percent who called themselves moderate Republicans said that climate change is real, but just 38 percent of conservative Republicans and 29 percent of Tea Party Republicans agreed.“There’s a simmering struggle within the Republican Party to define their stance on climate change,” and Anthony Leiserowitz, an author of the study. “It’s part of the bigger struggle you’re seeing within the Republican establishment and the Tea Party.”The split could prove to be a challenge for 2016 Republican candidates hoping to win over conservative donors and “super PACs.” Deep-pocketed advocacy groups like Americans for Prosperity have made it clear that they’ll attack candidates in the primaries who support climate-change policy.Climate change was almost never mentioned in the 2012 presidential race, but it will be impossible to ignore next year. Among the most consequential decisions facing the next president will be whether to carry out President Obama’s proposed climate change rules or try to undo them.— Coral DavenportOne of the major questions of the new Congress is which Democrats will be willing to break ranks and work with Republicans, who now hold majorities in both the House and Senate. Some early votes last week provided a few clues.In the House, 12 Democrats joined with Republicans in voting to define full-time work as 40 hours per week under the new health care law, and 28 Democrats voted for the Keystone XL pipeline. More tellingly, eight Democrats voted with Republicans in both instances, guaranteeing that they would be courted by Republicans on future votes. The eight included two freshmen, Representatives Brad Ashford of Nebraska and Gwen Graham of Florida.In the Senate, Democrats split on an unsuccessful attempt by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to change a Wall Street provision in a terrorism insurance bill. Thirteen Democrats voted against Ms. Warren, and Republicans looking for Democratic votes will be sure to remember them.— Carl HulseThe Supreme Court begins hearings at 10 a.m., including in the First Amendment case Reed v.

"PhotoGood Wednesday morning from Washington, where election watchers mull the implications of a meeting between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is expected to make his presidential ambitions official in April, the stalemate over Homeland Security funding grows more complicated, and conservative and business groups fight over the future of the Export-Import Bank. And in Chicago, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida is to make his first foreign policy address since declaring his interest in becoming the latest Bush in the White House.With just over a week to go before financing for the Department of Homeland Security runs out in a fight over immigration policy, Congress seems no closer to a resolution even as President Obama‘s immigration plan has been upended by a federal judge in Texas.Both Republicans and Democrats said that it would take a few days for the ruling’s repercussions to become clear, but that they did not see it as changing the deep stalemate that could cut off funds to the security agency after Feb. 27.If anything, one official said, the ruling could make conservative Republicans more determined — now that a federal judge has taken their side — to prohibit the financing of Mr. Obama’s immigration initiatives. At the same time, Senate Democrats who are blocking a bill that includes those prohibitions say they remain united and will not back down in another procedural vote set for next week.Senior aides said there had been little to no communication between the two sides, or any new effort to achieve a breakthrough. Congressional leaders will probably wait until returning from their Presidents’ Day recess next week to gauge the sentiments of their caucuses and proceed from there. This one looks like it is going down to the wire — if not past it.— Carl HulseStay tuned throughout the day @NYTpolitics for First Draft updatesThe Department of Homeland Security is not alone when it comes to being on shaky federal ground. The Export-Import Bank could go out of business at the end of June if Congress doesn’t act.The conservative advocacy group Heritage Action hopes that is exactly what happens.To that end, it is starting a campaign of automated phone calls to voters in the districts of 31 Republicans who have signed on to a measure renewing the bank’s charter.The calls label the bank, which is intended to spur American exports by providing aid to potential buyers, a “slush fund for corporate welfare.” Voters are encouraged to “tell your congressman to stop giving taxpayer-backed loans to multinational corporations and hostile foreign governments.”Michael A. Needham, the advocacy group’s chief executive, said, “Americans didn’t give Republicans a historic House majority to hand out favors to K Street lobbyists and well-connected special interests.”The campaign is a pre-emptive move. The bank’s supporters are to fly in next week to present the message that it is needed to level the playing field for American companies whose competitors overseas benefit from foreign government subsidies.— Carl HulseWith Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky getting closer to making the all-but-certain announcement that he will run for president — he is looking at April 7 as the big day — he and his advisers appear more confident than ever that they will resolve one of the biggest uncertainties looming over his aspirations.Kentucky law forbids anyone from appearing twice on the same ballot. And since Mr. Paul has said he wants to run both for president and for re-election to the Senate (as a Plan B in case his White House dreams don’t pan out), he needs to get around what has become a stubborn legal problem.His aides insist that it is not a significant hurdle. And the people close to Mr. Paul who spoke about his announcement plans said the only way that the senator would not run was if his family vetoed it. Kentucky election law would have nothing to do with it.The aides see two possible ways to get around the law. The first is to switch Kentucky from a primary state to a caucus state for the presidential nomination only, and to hold the caucus early. That would allow Mr. Paul to run for the presidency in the caucus and for Senate re-election on the primary ballot in May. Mr. Paul plans to present that proposal to the Kentucky Republican Party next month.The second option, which is gaining popularity among Republicans, is to file suit. Mr. Paul already believes the Kentucky law is unconstitutional, and he has considered challenging it in court.— Jeremy W.

"PhotoGood Thursday morning from Washington, where 10,000 conservatives activists are gathering at the Conservative Political Action Conference, eager to take back the White House; Loretta E. Lynch is expected to win the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee as attorney general; and the brinkmanship continues on Capitol Hill over the Homeland Security financing bill. It’s also a city where, as of 12:01 a.m., marijuana is now legal. That has not gone unnoticed among some of the younger conservatives at CPAC, which is being held just outside the city, in Maryland.Roughly 10,000 conservative activists have driven, flown or taken a bus or train to the Washington area for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. They can pick and choose their parties and panels, and it won’t be a surprise if they run into a potential Republican presidential candidate.The gathering began on Wednesday with the opening of a three-day Activism Boot Camp featuring modern campaign workshops like “The Making of a Political Pundit: A Newsroom Insider’s View on Getting on TV” or “From Campus to Camera: How These Millennial Spokes People Got Their Start.”Starting on Thursday, the 2016 presidential hopefuls get a chance to test their appeal with this younger, libertarian-leaning crowd.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey gets his first shot at 1 p.m. in a chat with the conservative radio host Laura Ingraham. Mr. Christie has used other CPAC appearances to revive his political prospects — as he did last year after the George Washington Bridge lane-closing scandal erupted — and his remarks this year could help energize his struggling 2016 effort.Next up will be Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard (and former California Senate candidate), and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, both of whom are expected to receive warm receptions.On Thursday afternoon, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin will take the stage for an eagerly anticipated speech. There is widespread hope that he can bridge the gap between the libertarian and establishment wings of the Republican Party, and his address will be dissected for signs that he can do it.— Nick CorasanitiA major federal agency will run out of money in just 48 hours. In most instances, that would be a crisis. But in the weird world of congressional brinkmanship, it is not dire enough.As House Republicans made their calculations this week in the fight over financing for the Department of Homeland Security, veterans of past showdowns said the clock needed to run down to 24 hours, or even 12, before there would be any action.Experience has shown that House Republicans need to be right up against it before they relent — if they ever will — and the betting on Capitol Hill is that they will agree to a short-term extension to allow more time for debate.Still, some top aides predicted that House Republicans would not drop their insistence that the bill include restrictions on the president’s immigration policy. That would force a veto, if Republicans can get it to President Obama’s desk.So despite movement in the Senate on a financing bill without conditions on immigration policy, this drama has a few acts to go.— Carl HulseThe Senate Judiciary Committee is expected to approve the nomination of Loretta E. Lynch to be the next attorney general, with a handful of Republicans joining the committee’s Democrats in backing her.The Federal Communications Commission holds a hearing on net neutrality.

Like, did anyone bring a beer funnel? Or did you hear Washington has legalized marijuana? Emojis are running amok.But our favorite post here at First Draft was a photograph of a bathtub full of Keystone Light beer, with a caption that reads: “In honor of Obama vetoing keystone pipeline, I will be filling my hotel bathtub with keystone beer.

"PhotoGood Monday morning from Washington, where a speech by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel will compete for attention this week with Supreme Court arguments and a potential government shutdown. Republicans head to the next big event and find time to meet with potential donors as the money primary heats up. And Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican, takes issue with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and dismisses the presidential prospects of his colleagues.After weeks of sniping and diplomatic intrigue, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel will address a joint meeting of Congress on Tuesday, just one of the events that will have Washington transfixed this week.Mr. Netanyahu will first speak on Monday at the annual policy conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee at Washington’s convention center. His remarks will undoubtedly be parsed to see what they hold for his Tuesday appearance, in what is promising to be a packed House chamber — even if some congressional Democrats don’t show, in protest.In most weeks, Mr. Netanyahu’s speech, which came at the invitation of congressional Republicans who initially kept the White House out of the loop, would overshadow any competing news events. But there are a few other attractions absorbing the attention of the capital and the news media.On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the conservative challenge to the Affordable Care Act. A ruling against the Obama administration this year could undermine the new insurance program by denying federal subsidies to millions of people, throwing its future into doubt. The law narrowly survived one Supreme Court challenge in 2012, and court watchers will be monitoring the questions the justices will throw at lawyers for hints of how this one might turn out.Last but not least, there is the continuing fight over financing the Department of Homeland Security. All the chaos in Congress last Friday bought lawmakers only one week to find a solution to how to fund the agency and deal with the objections of Republicans who want the money held up unless President Obama‘s immigration policies are blocked.Given the depth of the disagreements, any deal will no doubt take all week to hash out. The fight will be renewed on Monday night with a procedural vote in the Senate on beginning negotiations with the House. Democrats promise to filibuster it.— Carl HulseThe Conservative Political Action Conference drew more than a half-dozen potential Republican presidential hopefuls to the National Harbor in Maryland last week to make their pitches.

Jeb Bush of Florida will attend both, but only after a visit to a Las Vegas community center.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will be in the Senate all week, where he is expected to unveil his plan for comprehensive tax overhaul.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey will also attend both forums, and he will host a town-hall-style meeting in his state before that.The Wisconsin State Legislature moves forward with a so-called right-to-work bill that would prohibit workers in the private sector from being required to pay union dues. It is a measure that Gov. Scott Walker supports.And on the other side of the political aisle, Hillary Rodham Clinton will speak at a gala in Washington hosted by Emily’s List, which is dedicated to electing women to higher office.— Maggie HabermanPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel addresses the annual conference of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee in Washington.Secretary of State John Kerry travels to Geneva, where he will address the 28th session of the United Nations Human Rights Council. United States officials have accused the council of being hostile toward Israel.The Supreme Court will hear a challenge by Arizona Republicans to the state’s redistricting process.The Commerce Department releases reports on personal income and construction spending for January.Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 2 House Republican, on Sunday became the most senior party member to call for Senate Republicans to change rules and eliminate the ability to filibuster legislation after a Democratic blockade has tied Republicans in knots over Homeland Security funding.Putting aside the fact that House Republicans never complained about their Senate colleagues mounting filibusters while in the minority, there are several reasons what Mr. McCarthy endorsed on NBC’s “Meet the Press” is very unlikely to happen anytime soon.First of all, it would look very hypocritical for Senate Republicans to reverse themselves so quickly after conducting so many filibusters themselves and then complaining that Democrats had all but destroyed the Senate by lowering the filibuster threshold on nominations. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has been particularly outspoken on the need to preserve the traditions of the Senate.More important, eliminating the filibuster now would mean only that a bill would get sent to President Obama for a veto. Mr. McCarthy might like how that looks, but it is not much of a payoff for such a monumental change. If a change is in the cards, the time to do it is when there is a president in the White House who will sign the bills the Senate minority is filibustering.— Carl HulseSenator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Senate’s president pro tem who stands third in the line of presidential succession, is less than bullish on the presidential hopes of his fellow Republican senators: Ted Cruz of Texas, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida.“I don’t think senators have much chance running for president,” Mr. Hatch said during an interview last week in his office at the Capitol. “If they’re doing their job, they can’t run for president. And if they don’t do their job, then that’ll be used against them.”Instead, Mr. Hatch focused on the prospects of “five really outstanding governors” or former governors: Jeb Bush of Florida, Chris Christie of New Jersey, Scott Walker of Wisconsin, John R. Kasich of Ohio and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana.“Any one of them would make a better president than what we have right now, or better than what the Democrats are likely to put up in 2016,” he said.Mr. Hatch, who ran briefly for the 2000 Republican nomination, responded tartly to Mr. Cruz’s assertion at last week’s Conservative Political Action Conference that the biggest divide was not between Democrats and Republicans but between “the people” and “career politicians” in Washington.“That’s kind of a cliché,” said Mr. Hatch, 80, who was first elected in 1976. “I don’t think anybody wants to be a career politician. I’ve never considered this a job.”One reason Congress struggles, Mr. Hatch noted, is because “we’ve got a small segment of our Republicans — and they’re not really Republicans, they’re independents really who are so far to the right that they don’t see anything good in working with the people on the left at all.”— John HarwoodThough the 2016 campaign is not yet officially underway, the money primary is in full swing as Republican presidential hopefuls appear at a series of exclusive gatherings convened by deep-pocketed donors. (This is complete with a guide to candidate appearances across the country.)The appearance by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at a joint meeting of Congress this week has turned into a “political showdown,” causing consternation among Jewish Democrats in Congress and dividing Israelis.The Supreme Court will hear arguments this week in a challenge to the Affordable Care Act.

There were similar peaks in other metrics, like matches and messages.Indeed, attendees who hoped to see the next president at the conference also hoped to find a potential match at the gathering of like-minded political activists.One wrote on Twitter: “Definitely looking for my future husband! #CPAC2015.”— Nick Corasaniti",politics
"PhotoGood Monday morning from Washington, where a Keystone pipeline measure is likely to hit President Obama’s desk (and a promised veto) this week, a top Clinton Foundation official prepares to sign on to Hillary Rodham Clinton’s expected campaign, and a White House correspondent grades the president on his approach to race relations. And a weekend trip to Iowa shows the difficulties that Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky will have in putting together a winning Republican coalition.Congress will mark its last week before the first recess of 2015 with the House likely to approve the Keystone XL pipeline project — a move that would set up a veto showdown between President Obama and congressional Republicans.The House is scheduled to vote on the Keystone measure, which has already been approved by the Senate, about midweek and plans to send it to the president’s desk before leaving for a weeklong Presidents’ Day break.In the Senate, Republicans are trying to figure out their next move on the stalled Homeland Security financing bill after Democrats voted three times last week to block the measure from coming to the floor. Democrats have remained united against attempts to move ahead with the legislation, which would gut the president’s executive actions on immigration.The real pressure for a resolution might not come until after the break. The deadline for financing the Department of Homeland Security is Feb. 27.In another development, the White House is expected this week to send Congress a proposed Authorization for Use of Military Force Against the Islamic State, a resolution that Republicans and some Democrats have been demanding for months. The proposal will set up a debate over the extent of power that Congress is willing to extend to Mr. Obama in continuing military operations in Syria and Iraq.Stay tuned throughout the day @NYTpolitics for First Draft updatesDennis Cheng, a trusted aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton, will leave his post at the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation this week and is expected to join Mrs. Clinton’s campaign preparation efforts as a fund-raiser.He would be an important addition to the operation. Financial backing is essential before a candidate can register an official exploratory committee with the Federal Election Commission, which Mrs. Clinton is likely to do in April.“You can say, ‘I haven’t decided,’ and the press can go along with it, but as far as the F.E.C. and the law is concerned, you’re a candidate,” said Kenneth Gross, a campaign finance lawyer.Mr. Cheng, 35, served as deputy chief of protocol at the State Department under Mrs. Clinton and as the New York finance director on her 2008 presidential campaign.During his three and a half years at the Clinton Foundation, Mr. Cheng helped the philanthropic group tap into a vast donor base to build up a $246 million endowment in 18 months, according to a Clinton Foundation email announcing his departure.More recently, Mr. Cheng has balanced his foundation job with meetings to screen potential 2016 campaign fund-raisers.The coming weeks are a crunch time for the Clinton Foundation, before its donors turn to the campaign. It will hold its annual gala in New York next month.— Amy ChozickSenator Rand Paul of Kentucky is learning the limits of his anti-establishment stance if he wants to win the Republican nomination in 2016.Mr. Paul has the tricky task of stitching together a coalition of libertarians, traditional Republicans and people who tend to vote for Democrats. The difficulties he faces were evident over the weekend when he appeared in Marshalltown, Iowa, with Representative Rod Blum, a freshman Republican. As Mr. Blum introduced Mr. Paul, he spoke about casting his first vote in Congress against John A. Boehner for speaker.“I don’t report to John Boehner. I report to all of you wonderful people,” the senator told a crowd that had gathered in a sports bar to see him.The room erupted in applause. Mr. Paul stood there looking on.— Jeremy W. PetersDear Mr. Prime Minister: There are no hard feelings. Sincerely, the White House.That was the message to Benjamin Netanyahu about why Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. won’t be there next month when the Israeli prime minister addresses Congress.According to Betty K. Koed, the associate historian at the Senate Historical Office, vice presidents have missed such occasions often — 22 times since 1980.Vice President Dick Cheney wasn’t there in 2007 when President Nicolas Sarkozy of France professed his love of America in an effort to smooth the hard feelings after France opposed the Iraq war.His predecessor, Al Gore, was often elsewhere when foreign leaders visited, missing five speeches in a row. During the first Bush administration, Vice President Dan Quayle sent his good wishes from Los Angeles when Nelson Mandela visited Washington in 1990.Still, said Bruce Oppenheimer, a public policy professor at Vanderbilt University, “One should assume that Biden’s absence is meant to reiterate a message.”“The fact that V.P.’s have missed similar events in the past just provides a deniability cover,” he said.— Alan RappeportHe may be the first African-American commander in chief, but that doesn’t mean President Obama gets straight A’s when it comes to race relations.In her new book on presidents and race, April Ryan, the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Networks, graded the three presidents she has covered on their handling of race in America.Over all, she gave Mr. Obama a B-plus, tied with Bill Clinton but better than George W. Bush, whom she gave a C-minus. She credited Mr. Obama for diversity in his appointments, his support for civil rights and his outreach to at-risk youth. But she gave him a B on international outreach — lower than the A she gave Mr. Bush for his anti-AIDS program in Africa — and a C on jobs and unemployment.Mr. Obama actually improved his grade before the final version of the book, “The Presidency in Black and White: My Up-Close View of Three Presidents and Race in America,” was published this month. He originally had a B, ranking him below Mr. Clinton. But Ms. Ryan said she increased his score because of his handling of the racial tumult in Ferguson, Mo.Ms. Ryan writes that she respects each of the three presidents she has seen up close even as she argues that none of them has done enough to heal the racial divide in American society.“As I have seen presidential administrations come and go, I can assure you that each incoming commander in chief has the best of intentions,” she wrote. “Each one has seemed very earnest and eager to do the best job he could.” But “until we have a president who bravely tackles the race issue,” she added, “our progress will be limited.”— Peter BakerThey’ve been in town for over a month and are just starting to get comfortable, these new members of Congress.Now that the initial shock has worn off, we’ve started a weekly sit-down with the rookies of Congress, getting to know their backgrounds, thoughts, positions and policies.First up is Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts, a Harvard graduate who joined the Marines just a few months before Sept. 11, 2001.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is here in Washington to meet with President Obama at the White House this morning and to attend a meeting at the World Bank in the afternoon.Gov.

It is very common, though.” Merriam-Webster says that “hone in” seems to have “established itself in American English,” but “use of it especially in writing is likely to be called a mistake.”Ultimately, we have to follow “The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage,” which says that “hone” means sharpen and “is not used with ‘in.’ ”— Steve Kenny“Believer: My Forty Years in Politics,” the new book by President Obama’s political strategist, David Axelrod, may frustrate readers “who would figure that a book by his consigliere might provide novel insights” about the president, Robert Draper writes in his review.Leaders of the Working Families Party in New York on Sunday formally called on Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts to seek the Democratic nomination for president next year.A late court ruling in Alabama may stop the state’s first same-sex marriages and lead to legal turmoil.Which Brian Williams is the real Brian Williams?

"PhotoGood Tuesday morning from Washington. Talk of 2016 grows louder as fractures appear in Hillary Rodham Clinton’s coalition, Jeb Bush’s new tech chief has Twitter troubles, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida snags a coveted aide, and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey woos residents of a Des Moines suburb (again). On Capitol Hill, Ashton B. Carter is skating through the nomination process to become defense secretary, but confirmation for Loretta B. Lynch as attorney general is held up. We wrap up with President Obama offering an olive branch to Michael Jordan.Fractures appeared on Monday among Hillary Rodham Clinton’s supporters with the resignation of David Brock from the board of Priorities USA Action, a “super PAC” that is intended to raise millions of dollars for her campaign.Mr. Brock accused PAC officials of an “orchestrated hit job” on his groups after an article appeared in The New York Times detailing a dispute over how to share fund-raising proceeds.By the end of the day, a Priorities USA board member had issued a statement saying that the group’s leaders were “working to address” Mr. Brock’s concerns. He, in turn, said he was “open to returning to the board, and I share their desire to find a way to move forward.”On the Republican side, Jeb Bush’s new tech chief, Ethan Czahor, a founder of Hipster.com, quickly ran into trouble for his unfettered Twitter posts demeaning women and discussing his feelings about men who stare at him at the gym. Democrats pounced, the offending messages were deleted and Mr. Czahor said, also on Twitter, that he had “deleted some old jokes i made years ago that i no longer find funny or appropriate.” He kept his job.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has hired a former Mitt Romney aide to supervise his political activities in New Hampshire, the first primary state, and throughout the Northeast. It is a coup for Mr. Rubio, because the aide, Jim Merrill, who is based in New Hampshire, directed both of Mr. Romney’s primary bids there. A number of Mr. Rubio’s potential rivals were also hoping to hire him.— Nicholas Confessore, Alan Rappeport and Jonathan MartinStay tuned throughout the day @NYTpolitics for First Draft updatesChris Christie just can’t get enough of Iowa. The New Jersey governor was on his third visit of the new year on Monday in what is clearly a play for the votes of Republicans seeking a center-right candidate in the Iowa presidential caucuses, still a year away.Mr. Christie has visited far more frequently — 13 trips since 2010 by his count — than his potential establishment rivals, former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin.He opened some daylight with Mr. Bush on Monday when he told one Iowan who asked about the Common Core educational standards that he had “grave concerns.”“We’re re-examining it in New Jersey,” he said.His early-and-often-to-Iowa strategy is a gamble. The governor’s strategists in Iowa, where “moderate Republican” can be an epithet, believe that voters will want an electable candidate rather than one who is ideologically pure but cannot win the nomination. But Mr. Christie’s challenge was clear in a recent poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers. Nearly half, 46 percent, said he was “too moderate.”The blustery Christie was not in evidence on Monday as he gave solid, middle-of-the-road Republican answers about Israel and the national debt. The crowd responded warmly.Afterward, promising to return to Iowa next month for an agriculture forum, Mr. Christie stepped into a black S.U.V. after telling reporters, “I’ve got to get back to New Jersey, guys.’’— Trip GabrielAshton B. Carter appears headed for confirmation as defense secretary by the end of the week, but the nomination of Loretta E. Lynch for attorney general is moving much more slowly, and Senate Democrats are annoyed.Ms. Lynch’s nomination is on the Judiciary Committee’s agenda for Thursday, but Republicans on the panel say they expect to delay that vote for at least a week. And because the Senate is taking a recess for Presidents’ Day, it’s really a two-week delay. That is likely to push the full Senate vote into March, nearly four months since her nomination.Under Judiciary Committee traditions, any committee member can ask for an additional week on a nomination. Democrats certainly won’t request more time, but Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the panel, said he anticipated a further delay. At least three Republicans have already announced their opposition to Ms. Lynch.Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, noted that when he was the committee’s chairman after Democrats took over the Senate in 2007, he did not delay a vote on the nomination of Michael B. Mukasey, President George W. Bush‘s choice for attorney general, even though Mr. Leahy opposed the appointment.Another Lynch delay, he said, would represent “an unfortunate break in precedent.”— Carl HulsePresident Obama suggested on Monday that if he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington next month, it could become a political issue in Israel.There’s evidence to back that up.Before the Israeli elections in 2013, Mr. Netanyahu’s political coalition broadcast an advertisement that showed the prime minister addressing a joint meeting of Congress. The commercial’s message: “When Netanyahu speaks, the world listens.”Two years later, Mr. Netanyahu is again set to address Congress. This time, he faces criticism, both at home and abroad, that he is turning a diplomatic visit into a political opportunity. Many Democrats already consider him an unwelcome guest because he was invited by congressional Republicans before Mr. Obama was informed.Mr. Netanyahu and his Likud party face Israeli voters next month. That leaves plenty of time to cut a new ad after this speech — if he is feeling particularly bold.— Jeremy W. PetersGov. Chris Christie returns to New Jersey. Gov.

The conversation quickly turned to Mr. Jordan — who played for Mr. Smith — and the well-reported tensions between the president and the former Chicago Bulls star.They started last year when Mr. Jordan criticized the president’s golf game and called him a “hack” on the green. Mr. Obama responded that Mr. Jordan — a golfer himself — should focus his attentions on the perennially struggling Charlotte Hornets, which he owns.Then there was the incident involving a basketball poster that Mr. Jordan signed “To Barrack,” which the president’s political adviser, David Axelrod, revealed this week in an interview with New York magazine.On Monday, Mr. Obama was diplomatic, saying he didn’t hold grudges and understood that Mr. Jordan was simply “hypercompetitive” and liked to trash talk.“I’m going to forgive him for all of that,” said Mr. Obama, an ardent Bulls fan, “because I have six championship memories that will never go away.”— Alan RappeportThere’s judicial chaos in Alabama as same-sex marriages begin in some parts of the state.

"PhotoGood Wednesday morning from Washington, where the already frosty relations between the White House and congressional Republicans are growing cooler and the Secret Service has untethered a fleet of test drones. In 2016 campaign news, New Hampshire is cranking up its primary-season machinery, a former Ohio governor is taking on a sitting Ohio senator, and a former Los Angeles mayor has decided to sit out the race for Senator Barbara Boxer’s seat. We start with a look at the Conservative Political Action Conference, which we hope will provide some insight into the Republican presidential contest.The annual Conservative Political Action Conference is an imperfect indicator of the state of the political right. But the gathering provides a big stage for Republican hopefuls a year before the presidential primary season.Here are the five questions we’ll be looking to have answered as the meeting gets underway just outside Washington:Can Jeb Bush appeal to movement conservatives?His CPAC appearance will offer insight into how well the former Florida governor can connect with his party’s base. This will be his first conservative cattle call since creating a political action committee to finance his campaign activities, and he’s limiting himself to a question-and-answer session. We will be looking to see his resolve when questions about his support for a more welcoming immigration policy and the Common Core education standards come up, as they invariably will.Will Scott Walker live up to the hype?The Wisconsin governor has been the hottest commodity in Republican politics for the past month. With many Republicans curious to see what the buzz is about, he is going to face higher expectations than he would have before his breakout performance at a Republican forum in Iowa a few weeks ago. Watch to see if he adds media-bashing to his stump speech to ingratiate himself with the crowd.Can Chris Christie turn the page?Mr. Christie is also going to be expected to deliver big. The New Jersey governor has had a difficult few months, and his challenge grew only more difficult this week when a state judge rejected his public employee pension plan. The CPAC audience may be expecting him to show up with a new rationale and policy vision for his candidacy. With his approval numbers at home slipping, running on his state record could prove difficult.Who will connect with the next G.O.P. generation?College students make up a significant portion of the CPAC crowd. Some of them lean libertarian and are likely to support Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky. We’ll be looking to see if any of the other would-be candidates have appeal for the non-Paulites. That will offer clues about what rouses the next generation of Republicans.Which issue excites the base the most?Speaking about clues regarding the state of the party, watch which applause lines ring the loudest. The threat posed by the Islamic State is a galvanizing issue for many Republicans, but it’s unclear whether an audience heavy on Paul-supporting students will feel the same. We’re also keen to see whether conferencegoers respond more heartily to attacks against President Obama or to shots at Hillary Rodham Clinton.— Jonathan MartinStay tuned throughout the day @NYTpolitics for First Draft updatesThe White House and congressional Republicans are going through a particularly rough stretch.There’s the continuing fight over Homeland Security financing, and on Tuesday, the president vetoed the Republican-backed Keystone XL pipeline bill. Next week will feature the contentious address to Congress by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel — a speech arranged by Republicans without first consulting the White House. That will be followed by Supreme Court arguments on a conservative challenge to the president’s health care law.President Obama‘s rejection of the Keystone legislation was thoroughly telegraphed, but Republican officials say they don’t know how much resentment over it will spill into attempts to settle the Homeland Security fight. Money for the agency runs out at the end of the week, and the Keystone veto “certainly doesn’t help,” one official said.And on Wednesday, the president heads to Miami for a town-hall-style meeting to promote the immigration policies that have so infuriated Republicans.Top Republicans warned that rank-and-file hostility toward the president’s agenda and approach is likely to hinder attempts at cooperation on issues, even when there is significant agreement, including a push to grant Mr. Obama special power to cut trade deals.— Carl HulseWednesday signals another early milestone in the 2016 campaign as WMUR-TV in Manchester, N.H., tapes its first “Conversation With the Candidate” — a ritual for those who want to compete in the state’s primary.Save the Children Action Network is sponsoring this year’s series, which in 2012 was backed by AARP. The show includes an interview and questions from the audience.

"PhotoGood Friday morning from Washington, where Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Newt Gingrich and other big names on the right make their way to the Conservative Political Action Conference, the Senate Judiciary Committee approves the nomination of Loretta E. Lynch as attorney general, the deadline to finance the Department of Homeland Security comes down to the wire and the administration has proposed banning the manufacture and sale of popular bullets used in AR-15 semiautomatic rifles. And there was a snowball fight on Capitol Hill led by Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma.There were laugh lines, standing ovations, jokes that fell flat, high-flying oratory and political barbs adroitly delivered — sometimes all in the same speech — as a parade of high-profile Republicans preached to the (usually) friendly audiences on Thursday at the Conservative Political Action Conference.Not a few of the speakers are on the 2016 presidential shortlist, and here are three who left an impression:Score One for Ted CruzThe Texas senator urged the crowd to pay attention to which speakers had the records to back up their talk and which didn’t, the clear implication being that he was among the few who did.“I’m pretty confident you haven’t seen any speakers come up yet to say, ‘I’m a squishy moderate who stands for nothing,’ ” Mr. Cruz said.Scott Walker Needs a New Opening LineA current favorite among conservatives, the Wisconsin governor walked away from his speech with the hall ringing with cheers.But that was after a stilted opening about his childhood.“I loved reading about our founding fathers,” he said to a suddenly silent audience. “They were like superheroes. Bigger than life.”Mr. Walker has faced criticism that he may be too dull to win the White House for the Republicans. He’s trying to shed that image, but he may need some pointers on how to get off to a more rousing start.Chris Christie Lives Up to His ReputationHe denounced elites, The New York Times and his critics back home.And the New Jersey governor was not reluctant to give himself a pat on the back, saying he was one politician who refused to wait on the prevailing winds before making a decision.“I don’t have political consultants whispering in my ear,” he said, who dictate his actions.It’s another day of big names at the Conservative Political Action Conference: Bush, Gingrich, Hannity, Norquist, Paul, Perry, Rubio, Reagan, Clinton.Reagan? Clinton?One of them is dead (the former president), and the other will certainly not be there (the former first lady, senator and secretary of state), but Hillary Rodham Clinton will be on a lot of conservative minds during Friday night’s Ronald Reagan Dinner (on the heels of the Ronald Reagan Reception.)That’s because “Hillary: The Movie” is scheduled to be screened during dinner. It’s more than just a conservative takedown of Mrs. Clinton; the movie is, in itself, celebrated among Republicans for the role it played in the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision that eased restrictions on campaign contributions. (In brief: The film was produced by Citizens United, which filed suit after the Federal Communications Commission refused to allow its broadcast as “electioneering communication.”)The CPAC agenda describes the 2008 documentary’s anti-Clinton content this way: “Everything you’ve forgotten, and what you need to know.”— Steve KennySenator James M. Inhofe took a snowball onto the Senate floor on Thursday, and the predictable happened: A snowball fight broke out.Mr. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who is well known for denying that humans play a role in climate change, offered the well-packed snowball as Exhibit A in his case against the “hysteria” of global warming.“It is very, very cold out,” said Mr. Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. “Very unseasonal.”Mr. Inhofe’s science project quickly touched off a blizzard of criticism on Twitter and from Democrats who said the lawmaker wasn’t snowing anyone.Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, noted the freakish weather that has battered his state (about 100 inches of snow) and attributed it to a winter “supercharged” by climate change.And Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, noted that virtually every major American scientific organization had judged man-made climate change to be reality.You can believe them, he said, “or you can believe the senator with a snowball.”— Carl HulseThe Senate again considers the Department of Homeland Security financing bill.President Obama meets with President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia to discuss the Ebola crisis.With his nominee for attorney general moving through the confirmation process, President Obama will speak at a Justice Department ceremony to commemorate the tenure of the current attorney general, Eric H.

Well, it turns out, other watchmen.At the Conservative Political Action Conference’s Activism Boot Camp, the opposition research firm America Rising hosted a seminar titled “We’re Watching You: How to Video Track 24/7.”Aaron Baer, the vice president of tracking at America Rising, offered tips on blending in (“Walk in like you belong”), using your cellphone for tracking (“hold it horizontally!”) and landing a silver-bullet soundbite (“it’s great and wonderful to have that moment,” but don’t go out of your way to hunt for it).But sitting in the back corner, tripod and camera in hand, was a tracker from American Bridge, an opposition research firm on the left.Mr. Baer quickly noticed and dispatched his tracker on hand, Ryan Powers, to tape the tracker in the back row.For a solid minute, the two trackers aimed their cameras at each other, a Wild West standoff for the digital age, before Mr. Powers holstered his camera and sat down.The meeting went on with no shots fired, no slips or gotchas, save from a few asides from Mr. Baer about the trackers’ presence in the room.

"PhotoGood Thursday morning from Washington, where Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. makes plans to be in Central America the day that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is to address Congress, and lawmakers urge Ashton B. Carter to address the problem of sexual assault in the military when he is confirmed as defense secretary. The end of the Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart shows leave politicians without a ready outlet for reaching younger voters. And someone leaked the new season of “House of Cards” — but wait, is that the scent of conspiracy?Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. travels to Des Moines on Thursday to promote the administration’s economic and education policies — and to subtly remind potential presidential caucusgoers that he could be enticed into the 2016 presidential race.But where will he be on March 3 when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel addresses Congress? Mr. Biden’s office has said he will be out of the country but has not said where, raising suspicions that he is simply skipping a speech that many here in Washington consider a snub of the White House.As it turns out, Mr. Biden is expected to be in Central America working on border and immigration issues.Officials said that the vice president was scheduled to meet with regional leaders in an effort to reach economic and security agreements that would stem the flow of migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras to the United States. The White House wants the agreements in place as it begins its push for a requested $1 billion in aid for the region.On Capitol Hill, Republicans remained skeptical, suggesting that Mr. Biden’s trip was manufactured as a convenient excuse.By the way, his absence means that Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican and new president pro tem of the Senate, will be seated behind Mr. Netanyahu, alongside Speaker John A. Boehner.— Carl HulseStay tuned throughout the day @NYTpolitics for First Draft updatesHe’s not scheduled to be confirmed as defense secretary until Thursday afternoon, but the pressure on Ashton B. Carter has already started.House members led by Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, have written a letter putting Mr. Carter on notice that they will be watching how he handles reports of sexual assault in the military.The letter, also signed by Representative Michael R. Turner, Republican of Ohio, and Representative Niki Tsongas, Democrat of Massachusetts, asks Mr. Carter to bring “the full weight of your office to bear on improving the military’s response to sexual assault and preventing it from happening in the first place.”The Pentagon released a survey on Wednesday showing that although students at the three military service academies reported fewer sexual assaults in the 2013-14 school year, more than 40 percent of those who had reported unwanted sexual contact also said they had faced retaliation.“We want to make sure that he does not let up on this,” Ms. Slaughter said in a telephone interview.— Helene CooperJon Stewart’s departure from “The Daily Show,” coming after the loss of “The Colbert Report,” not only creates a hole in Comedy Central’s lineup but leaves lawmakers and candidates without a critical outlet for reaching young voters.“Clearly both ‘Daily Show’ and ‘Colbert’ have been a draw for the younger age cohorts, especially relative to your mainstream news outlets,” said Amy Mitchell of the Pew Research Center.The median age of “Daily Show” viewers is 36, Ms. Mitchell said, and 39 percent were under 30 in 2012, the most recent data available from the Pew Center. “The Colbert Report,” which went off the air when Stephen Colbert left Comedy Central to replace David Letterman on CBS, had an even younger viewership.Such youth appeal has even those who have been mocked by Mr. Stewart mourning his departure.“As a fan and an occasional victim of Jon Stewart, I will certainly be sad to see him go,” Josh Earnest, White House press secretary, said in his daily briefing.Mr. Stewart’s audience leans Democratic, but “The Daily Show” has been a popular stop for Republicans who want to prove their cool and their mettle under the host’s needling.“He was always fair to me on his show,” Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said, “even though he was wrong.”— Alan Rappeport* President Obama asked Congress for the authority to wage war against the Islamic State, but in trying to satisfy hawkish Republicans and nervous Democrats he sought to thread the needle: “I do not think America’s interests are served by endless war, or by remaining on a perpetual war footing.”* Speaker John A.

She will also take questions from the technology reporter Kara Swisher.It’s the first of two paid speeches that Mrs. Clinton is to deliver in the coming month. And that raises a question: Why is she still giving paid speeches?One reason: A nondeclared presidential campaign can’t be run on the cheap. An official campaign comes with a fund-raising apparatus and budget; until then, Mrs. Clinton must use her own money to pay the salaries of her growing team and the rent on a Midtown Manhattan office.Polling, essential for any prospective candidate, is another out-of-pocket expense, and she has also hired a firm to do “self-opposition research.”Mrs. Clinton’s speeches in February and March are related to her efforts on behalf of women and girls. (Read: No Wall Street banks or hedge funds.) Her advisers are betting that by November 2016, voters will have more pressing things to worry about than whether Mrs. Clinton spoke to women in Silicon Valley on Tuesday or camp counselors at a gathering in Atlantic City on March 19.Mrs. Clinton knows how expensive campaigns can be, especially if you don’t win. By the time she ended her 2008 campaign, Mrs. Clinton had spent $11.4 million of her own money and had accumulated $22.5 million in debt.That’s a lot of paid talks to the American Society of Travel Agents and the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries.— Amy ChozickStay tuned throughout the day @NYTpolitics for First Draft updatesIf there’s one thing that has been consistent over the last several meetings of the Conservative Political Action Conference, it’s that a member of the Paul family will do well in the annual presidential straw poll.Former Representative Ron Paul of Texas and his son Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky have won four of the last five straw polls at the Republican gathering, which tends to draw younger voters who are attracted to their libertarian message.So talk of changes to the poll has alarmed some groups that support the younger Mr. Paul, who is considering a 2016 campaign for president. They fear the alterations will make it more difficult for the candidate with the most energized and organized base to emerge victorious.“I hope that nothing nefarious is going on,” said Jeff Frazee, executive director of Young Americans for Liberty, which got its start as Students for Ron Paul during the 2008 presidential campaign. “That would take away from the credibility of the straw poll and CPAC.”The poll is traditionally conducted throughout the conference, with the results announced on the final day. This year, questions on specific issues will be included, and a follow-up questionnaire will be sent in six months to monitor changes in the way the candidates are viewed.Ned Ryun, a board member at the American Conservative Union, the conference host, said the changes were meant to provide a clearer view of campaign favorites beyond which potential candidate could bring in the most supporters. The value of the poll, he said, will be little changed.“I’m not going to say, as a board member, that it’s pointless,” Mr. Ryan said of the poll. “But it is what it is.”— Alan RappeportIt’s Election Day in Chicago, and the big question facing Mayor Rahm Emanuel is whether he can avoid another vote in six weeks.If Mr. Emanuel cannot surpass 50 percent of the votes on Tuesday, he will face the second-place finisher on April 7 — a prospect he wants to avoid.In the closing days of this race, Mr. Emanuel has been his usual peripatetic self, racing to events across Chicago to try to round up the final votes that could make the difference.Hoping to improve his standing among the city’s African-Americans, the mayor’s campaign team quickly assembled and broadcast a television commercial that featured President Obama‘s visit to the city last Thursday, when he gave his former chief of staff a big hug and called him the “mayor we need.”The voters will determine if that hug was enough.— Carl HulseA Republican “super PAC” uses the words of Senator Elizabeth Warren, a liberal Democrat, to score points against Hillary Rodham Clinton.Gov.

"PhotoGood Monday morning from Washington, where Congress is back in session but is still stalemated over the Department of Homeland Security financing bill, Republicans with presidential aspirations are polishing up their speeches for the Conservative Political Action Conference, and Kentucky’s governor is optimistic that Hillary Rodham Clinton can win the state next year. Have the post-Oscar parties ended in Hollywood yet? At the ceremony itself, political statements were the order of the evening.One speech ended in an impassioned call for women’s rights, another lamented the future of voting rights, and the final words of the night were about immigration. Oh, and Edward J. Snowden took home an Oscar. (In spirit, anyway.)The Academy Awards ceremony took a political left turn on Sunday night.Conservative publications like The New York Post and The Daily Caller had been cheerleading for “American Sniper,” the story of an Navy SEAL sharpshooter in Iraq. But although it has taken in $319 million at the box office — more than the other best picture nominees combined — “Sniper” earned only one minor trophy, and its director, Clint Eastwood, known for his libertarian-tinted conservatism and opposition to President Obama, never got a chance to take the stage.Patricia Arquette used her acceptance speech for best supporting actress to rally feminists. “It’s our time to have wage equality once and for all and equal rights for women in the United States of America,” she said as the crowd roared.The best documentary feature award went to “Citizenfour,” a movie about Mr. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, and his history-making leaks. “Thank you to Edward Snowden for his courage,” the filmmaker Laura Poitras said, “and to other whistle-blowers.”Next came the award for best song, “Glory,” from “Selma.” In accepting the Oscar, Common and John Legend noted that the Voting Rights Act at the center of the film “is being compromised right now.”“Birdman” won four awards, including best picture. Its director, Alejandro González Iñárritu, in the last speech of the night, dedicated the prize “for my fellow Mexicans,” saying that “I pray that we can find and build a government that we deserve.”And for Mexican immigrants in this country, he said, “I pray that they are treated with the same dignity and respect as the ones who came before and built this incredible immigrant nation.”— Steve KennyStay tuned throughout the day @NYTpolitics for First Draft updatesCongress returns this week with no sign of a compromise in a stalemate that could leave the Department of Homeland Security without any money to keep functioning.The Senate is to vote this evening for the fourth time on Senator Mitch McConnell’s attempt to begin debate on a House measure that would provide $40 billion for the department but would block President Obama‘s executive actions on immigration. And for the fourth time, the unified Democrats are expected to filibuster it.That leaves just three days to find a resolution or let the agency’s financing lapse, touching off furloughs and uncertainty in a period of rising terrorist threats like the one this weekend against the Mall of America in Minnesota.Very little discussion about a resolution appears to have taken place among congressional leaders during the Presidents’ Day recess.

But he and Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned aggressively for Alison Lundergan Grimes in last year’s Senate race only to see her lose to Senator Mitch McConnell by over 15 points. That has many Democrats predicting that Mrs. Clinton will not be able to compete there next year against the Republican presidential nominee.Kentucky’s governor, Steven L. Beshear, is not one of those Democrats.“It will be tough; it won’t be easy,” Mr. Beshear said in an interview between sessions at this weekend’s National Governors Association meeting. “But I think she’ll have an opportunity to do that.”Mr. Beshear noted he had seen Mr. Clinton twice since Election Day, once at a Clinton Foundation event in California and at the funeral of former Senator Wendell Ford of Kentucky and told the former president that his wife could carry the state.And how did Mr. Clinton reply?“He said, ‘Good,’ ” Mr. Beshear recalled with a chuckle.— Jonathan MartinRudolph W. Giuliani, faced with the uproar over his questioning of President Obama’s patriotism, challenged reporters last week to find examples of the president’s love of country.So we did.In 2008, when he was still a presidential candidate, Mr. Obama told thousands in Berlin: “I also know how much I love America.” At the Democratic National Convention later that year, he did it again: “I love this country, and so do you, and so does John McCain.” And again in 2001, in a meeting with voters in Illinois, recalling “why I love this country so much.”Over hundreds of speeches, Mr. Obama has paid tribute to the United States as “the greatest democratic, economic, and military force for freedom and human dignity the world has ever known.”Mr. Obama — as Mr. Giuliani, the former New York mayor, and other critics have pointed out — has also been vocal in discussing what he considers to be the country’s shortcomings. In fact, several of Mr. Obama’s most emphatic expressions of patriotism appear in proximity to his critiques of America.“I know my country has not perfected itself,” Mr. Obama said in Berlin. “But I also know how much I love America.”— Michael Barbaro and Michael D.

"Everything is ConnectedScott Dorsey, a Kellogg alum, understands the importance of the big picture. It’s unlikely his business would have grown from a three-person founding team to a multi-billion-dollar company if he let one department expand faster than the others. As co-founder and former CEO of Indianapolis-based ExactTarget, a digital marketing and analytics software company, Dorsey built a very collaborative leadership team and company culture to make sure every part of his business grew in tandem.In 2009, he and his leadership team created the company’s Accelerate 2013 plan, which detailed what it would take to become the dominant market leader in their space. “It was a very prescriptive four-year plan on how we were going to scale the business and what we were going to accomplish,” he says. By starting with the end in mind, the plan empowered leaders and workers throughout the business to make the near-term investments needed to produce long-term results.Even with his precise planning, there were times when one part of the business grew faster than another. “You always have a little disharmony, in that some functions are leading and pulling the rest of the company along,” says Dorsey. Instead of slowing things down, though, he found ways to speed things up in the other departments.",business
"At the time, Mickelson owed Walters gambling debts. Although he was a serious gambler, Mickelson was not a big stock trader, with only about $250,000 in the market, according to the S.E.C. Yet on July 30 and 31, 2012, after a series of phone calls and texts with Walters, Mickelson bought $2.4 million worth of Dean Foods stock — some of it with money he borrowed. “These were his first ever Dean Foods purchases,” the S.E.C. noted.You know, of course, what happened next: A week later, Dean Foods announced the WhiteWave spinoff. The stock jumped 40 percent. The very next day, Mickelson sold his Dean Foods stock, reaping a profit of $931,000.The case against Walters, as outlined by the S.E.C. and the United States attorney’s office, appears to be strong. In all, the government says, the inside information Walters got from Davis was worth $40 million. The government goes out of its way to play up the personal benefit Davis received in return. An inveterate gambler trying to keep up an unsustainable lifestyle, he owed money to the I.R.S. and others, including Walters. More than once, Walters bailed him out by either lending him money or arranging for a loan. The loans totaled nearly $2 million.It is also clear that Walters, who is alleged to have tipped off Mickelson in turn, got a benefit from his tippee. According to the S.E.C., Mickelson used some of his Dean Foods profits to pay back his gambling debt to Walters. But did Mickelson know about the personal benefit the original tipper, Davis, was receiving? I know it sounds a little strange, but that really is the key legal question in the wake of the Newman decision. If he didn’t know that Davis was receiving a personal benefit in return for giving inside information to Walters, he’s off the hook.(A quick aside: According to Forbes, Mickelson has reaped around $500 million in career earnings, and gets some $50 million a year in endorsement income. The fact that he was trading in Dean Foods to repay a debt to Walters surely raises questions about Mickelson’s financial decision-making, well apart from whether he traded on inside information.)In its complaint against Walters, the S.E.C. seems to have highlighted Mickelson’s involvement in the case. But ultimately, it merely named him a “relief defendant,” meaning that all he had to do was return the money he had made from the Dean Foods trade, plus interest. He readily agreed. (The total is about $1.03 million.)A spokesman for Mickelson issued a statement Thursday in which he said that Mickelson didn’t want to “benefit from any transaction that the S.E.C. sees as questionable.” He added that Mickelson regretted any “appearance” that he had fallen short of “the high professional and ethical standards that the companies he represents expect of their employees, associates and Phil himself.”",business

"LONDON — The French insurer AXA said on Friday that it had agreed to sell its SunLife and its Embassy pensions and investment business in Britain to Phoenix Group.This month, AXA said it was in talks to sell its remaining life insurance and savings business in Britain after a strategic review.Phoenix said it would pay 375 million pounds, or about $551 million, in cash for the business.As part of its exit from the life insurance and savings business in Britain, AXA also agreed this month to sell its portfolio advisory business, known as Elevate, to Standard Life for an undisclosed amount. In April, AXA agreed to sell its offshore investment bonds business, which is based on the Isle of Man, to Life Company Consolidation Group.Over all, AXA said that it expected to receive £632 million from the sale of its life insurance and savings units in Britain.

"Despite the end of 20-percent annual growth, many in the industry are expecting strong, steady growth for years.“I think we’re definitely seeing an uptick from a year ago,” said Jason Liao, chairman and C.E.O. of China Business Aviation Group. “I’m very positive. I think we’ll see an average of 10 percent, sustainable long-term growth.”China’s shift from being a global investment destination to becoming a global investor is also changing the market.“China’s commercial interests are spreading all over, to Africa, to South America, regions which are not necessarily their traditional markets,” Mr. Dixon said. “When they go looking for resources, they’re usually in remote areas, so access becomes crucial. How do you get from Beijing to Angola easily and when you want to? The answer is business aviation.”For many Chinese businesses, that means long-range, wide-body aircraft. The top two models delivered to China and Hong Kong in 2015 were Bombardier’s Global 6000 and Gulfstream’s G650, designed for long-range use. Bombardier’s 2015 market forecast predicts that greater China will account for 875 deliveries valued at $33 billion in the coming decade, with medium and large aircraft accounting for 90 percent.“Geographic positioning of the Asia Pacific region and distances between major cities necessitates the need for long-range aircraft,” said Khader Mattar, Bombardier’s vice president of sales for the Asia Pacific region and China. “We expect the Chinese market to be one of the four most active markets and to generate the most deliveries over the next 10 years.”China’s business aviation market should benefit from support from Beijing, which has mentioned general aviation in the past two five-year plans.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters.“General aviation is becoming one of the main directions in China’s national policy,” said Fang Xinyu, vice president of Deer Jet, China’s largest charter provider, now in its 21st year of operation. “The government is encouraging more investment in this industry.”Advertisement Continue reading the main storyLast year Deer Jet added two new fixed-base operators to its domestic network, which now totals eight. Its fleet size has dropped below 90 aircraft as it moves to replace older aircraft, and its turnover rose 10 percent, with its share of the Chinese charter market now at 70 percent, Mr. Fang said. The market is maturing but has far to go, he said. “We are still short of pilots, mechanics and even professional marketers.”Denzil White, C.E.O. at Deer Jet subsidiary Hongkong Jet, said the regulatory environment for business aviation in China also has room for improvement. “In America, I can decide at two o’clock in the afternoon that I want to leave at five o’clock from Los Angeles and fly to New York, and it’s quite possible to do it,” he said. “Here, if you get all your ducks in a row it’s a minimum of two days.”Other issues include restrictions on flight times, extremely limited flight paths due to military control of the skies and limited access to the high altitudes for which many jets are designed.A two-decade shortage of pilots has been addressed by more training centers, Mr. Liao said, but now there is a shortfall of captains, a problem that will be resolved in the coming two to three years once today’s first officers have met their flying hours requirements.A lack of sufficient slots and parking spaces at busier airports, especially Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA), where 132 business jets are served by a lone FBO , is also a major issue. “Hong Kong has a population in excess of seven million, with only one airport,” Mr. White said. “Most other major cities with this size population have a choice of four or more airports.”Hong Kong missed an opportunity to avoid this situation 18 years ago, when it could have retained its airport at Kai Tak for business jets. It has since been converted into a cruise ship terminal. As a result, a Hong Kong businessman returning home in his business jet may be denied landing and/or parking at HKIA due to slot restrictions, he said.To address that problem, Mr. White advocates forming a Pearl River Delta customs and immigration-free zone allowing business jets to land at airports in Hong Kong, Macau, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, and for passengers to commute within the zone by helicopter. “That would instantly resolve the parking and slot limitations for HKIA,” he said.China has fewer than 300 airports, against more than 5,000 in the United States. Mr. Liao said China is adding 20 airports a year and, even if that number rose, there are no short-term concerns of an airport glut for the world’s most populous country. “Even if they’re building 50 airports a year, in 10 years that’s 500, in 100 years that’s 5,000,” he said. “It’s still a very small number.”Mr. White emphasized the need for a vision for the development of China’s business aviation industry. “It is inevitable that the Chinese business jet population will eventually grow to a size similar to the U.S.,” he said. “However, without open skies, improved infrastructure and qualified manpower, this is not likely to happen in the near future.”Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMr. Dixon expressed cautious optimism that infrastructure gains may be followed by further liberalization of the operational environment. “Hopefully they will open up more airways and more airspace,” he said. “If you see how far China’s come since the eighties, it’s moved a long way, but we would like to see it move faster.”",business
"The manufacturing sector remains pressured by lower energy prices, which have eroded profits of energy companies and forced oil field services firms like Schlumberger and Halliburton to slash capital spending budgets.Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the economy, has also taken a knock from efforts by businesses to slim down an inventory bloat, which has undercut growth in new orders.

Zoomlion later raised its bid to $31 a share in March.The latest deal with Konecranes would allow Terex to continue its discussions with Zoomlion on a sale of Terex in whole or in part. The sale to Konecranes could be terminated for a fee of $37 million if Terex and Zoomlion reach an agreement before the end of May.The sale “to Konecranes is good for our customers, team members and shareholders,” John L.

"(The researchers tried to compile a similar data-set of high-compliance places where business owners are likely to report their earnings accurately, but it found only three. Those in Mott Haven, a neighborhood in the South Bronx; West Somerville, Mass.; and Portersville, Ind., appear to be unusually law-abiding.)What is behind the clusters? Community norms play a major role, the tax researchers theorized. Business owners who were less compliant in paying their taxes were more likely to be active in civic groups and religious congregations, and they “appear to exhibit a stronger association with local institutions than national ones such as the federal government.”In other words, if people at your neighborhood potlucks or trade group meetings take a dim view of Washington, you might be more inclined to do some fudging at tax time.Another surprise was the effectiveness of audits.Self-employed individuals who went through an audit and were found to be clean reported less income in subsequent years, a different study found. The drop wasn’t small: Three years after their audits, the study’s test group of taxpayers reported 35 percent less in taxable income than a control group of similar taxpayers who had not been audited.The researchers could only guess at a cause. The audit may have been a discouraging experience and sapped the subject’s “tax morale.” Or perhaps it inadvertently offered insight into previously unknown tactics for both legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion.Most audits are not random. The I.R.S. has a secret algorithm that it uses to calculate how likely each taxpayer is to have unreported income. Those with high scores are more likely to be audited — and once the auditors start digging, they usually find things. Of the 1.2 million individual returns that the agency audited (including sole proprietorships) in 2014, only 13 percent emerged without any tax adjustments.For those who dodge their taxes and get caught, the sting seems to fade fast. In the years right after an audit, taxpayers who had to make additional payments appeared to become a bit more compliant, but the effect diminished over time and disappeared entirely by Year 5, another study found.",business
"Perhaps the best example of the problem with Rio’s Olympic-mandated infrastructure is a new 10-mile rail line that will connect the hotels of Ipanema and Copacabana to the western suburb of Barra da Tijuca, where the Olympic Park has been built. It will cut the travel time from over an hour by car — on a good day — to less than 30 minutes. But after many delays, the rail line is now expected to open just four days before the opening ceremony. The cost has risen to $2.8 billion after an initial estimate of $1.6 billion. There are serious questions about whether there will be enough time to properly test the new line before putting it into use.There is also a question about how useful this new line will be after the Games. Barra da Tijuca is a relatively wealthy area, and the most urgent transportation needs are in poorer areas of Rio. “The building of the new subway line is problematic,” said Christopher Gaffney, a professor at the University of Zurich who studies large-scale sports events like the Olympics. “Extending that line meant they couldn’t afford to extend any other line where it was really needed. It is a poorly conceived, poorly executed project.”At this point, virtually all the problems troubling the country seem to be reflected in Rio’s Olympic preparation. Corruption? Prosecutors are investigating a number of construction companies building the Olympic sites, starting with Odebrecht, which is involved in over half the Olympic projects. Zika? The virus has caused some public health officials to call for the Games to be canceled, and a handful of athletes — the golfer Rory McIlroy, most recently — have declined to participate. Zika is the ultimate in bad publicity. Lack of money? The Brazilian organizers have had to cut about $500 million from the Olympic budget — affecting aspects of the Games including the opening and closing ceremonies (they’re being pared back) to the athletes’ dorm rooms, which won’t have televisions (the organizers were going to charge the athletes for air-conditioning but backed down).There have been other miscues, too. In April, a bike path that had been built next to the ocean as part of the Games’ infrastructure improvements collapsed, killing two people on the same day the Olympic torch was lit in Greece. (More bad news came Friday, when the World Anti-Doping Agency suspended the accreditation of a Rio lab that had been renovated, at great expense, to handle drug testing for the Games.)Last week, the governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro declared a state of “public calamity” — a declaration usually associated with a natural disaster — essentially acknowledging that the state was bankrupt and would be unable to honor its commitment to the Olympics without help. The federal government stepped in with an emergency $850 million loan, some of which will be used to complete the new rail line.The Games will go on, of course, and for those of us watching on television, it will be a splendid spectacle. Most of the Olympics will take place in a kind of bubble, divorced from the city’s problems. But after the Games end on Aug. 21, almost three weeks after they begin, most of us will move on. The people of Rio will be left to pick up the pieces.",business
"There are two things that are striking about Plank’s initial business model. The first is that his shirts were aimed strictly at elite athletes rather than the general public; he was making “performance wear,” as they say in the trade. The second was the way he built the Under Armour brand in the early days: by handing his shirts to football players he knew from high school or college who had gone on to the N.F.L.“My contacts among these N.F.L. players were a vital part of my strategy,” he later wrote in an article for the Harvard Business Review. (Although I was able to interview several top Under Armour executives for this column, Plank was unavailable, a company spokeswoman said.)In other words, endorsements have been critical to Under Armour’s success from the very beginning. The N.F.L. players who wore his shirts talked them up, which led teams, beginning with the Atlanta Falcons and the Giants, to start buying them for all the players. When the Miami Dolphins asked him to supply the team with free shirts, Plank said no. He needed to be able to sell to teams because they were his target market. (The Dolphins ended up buying the shirts.)Endorsements have been critical to Nike’s success, too, of course — indeed, they’ve been as much a part of the company’s marketing as the “Just Do It” commercials.Nike started with running shoes. In the company’s early days, the great University of Oregon runner, Steve Prefontaine, who was close to the Nike founders Phil Knight and Bill Bowerman (Oregon’s track coach for many years), wore its track shoes. John McEnroe was an early endorser of its tennis shoes. When Nike started selling basketball shoes in the late 1970s, it came up with the idea of paying college coaches to have their teams wear Nikes. And, of course, in 1984, Nike landed the greatest sports endorser of them all: Michael Jordan. His first signature shoe, the Air Jordan 1, was an instant success, and his appeal has continued well into his retirement. Today, the Jordan Brand, which is a Nike subsidiary, is a $3 billion business.Flush with cash, Nike now tries to corner the market on big-name basketball players — Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook also have big Nike contracts — while also trying to tie up as many other players as possible. Almost three in four N.B.A. players suit up with Nike shoes. “Nike’s approach is to have all the right guys to defend its position,” said David Abrutyn, a partner at Bruin Sports Capital. To put it another way, it spreads its bets.",business
"The Trump Organization, meanwhile, had decided to go all-in on golf; today it owns 17 resorts, up from three in 2007, and its golf resort business is most likely the largest fief of the Trump empire. Many of those properties were bought in the wake of the financial crisis, when the golf business was struggling, and many of those involved believe that golf owes Trump a debt of gratitude for investing in the sport during such a tough time.“I’ve been very good for golf,” Trump has said. Few would disagree.Trump’s purchase of Doral was typical of his approach: Seeing a chance to buy a distressed property, he scooped it up for $150 million, a discounted price Forbes magazine later described as “almost unbelievable.” He then sank $250 million into renovating it, including an overhaul of the Blue Monster.Although he lists its revenue, perhaps implausibly, as nearly $132 million in the most recent financial disclosure he submitted as part of his presidential run — up from $49.4 million in last year’s financial disclosure form — it is probable that Doral is his highest grossing and most profitable golf resort. Among his properties, only his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland ranks with Doral in terms of prestige.Well before Trump bought Doral, the PGA Tour had used it to host one of its four annual World Golf Championships — tournaments that, unlike most tour events, are restricted to the top players in the world. Beginning in 2011, Cadillac was the chief sponsor. (From 1962 to 2006, Doral hosted a more traditional PGA tournament, the Doral Open.) But Cadillac let it be known that it would be dropping its sponsorship. The 2016 tournament, which was held in March, was its last as a sponsor. And though it sought a new sponsor for over a year, the PGA Tour was simply unable to find a company to replace Cadillac.On Wednesday, when the tour commissioner, Tim Finchem, confirmed that the tournament was moving to Mexico City, he went out of his way to say the decision to leave Doral had not been a political statement. “From a golf standpoint, we have no issues with Donald Trump,” he said, adding, “The PGA has never been involved nor cares to be involved in presidential politics.”",business
"“More clients are dressing informally, and many parts of our business are already business casual,” JPMorgan’s operating committee wrote in the memo, which was reported on Friday by The Wall Street Journal. “And while it may not be possible to dress business casual at all times or in all areas, we believe having a firmwide guideline is the right thing to do.”JPMorgan employees have been dressing slightly more casually in recent years, sometimes drawing inspiration from their leadership. Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, went tieless at a meeting with employees in Bournemouth, England, on Friday. Joining him in the business casual look was George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer.Information technology workers and other behind-the-scenes employees already dress more informally. And bankers in certain regions, like Silicon Valley, sometimes wear khakis and sweaters in lieu of Ermenegildo Zegna suits or Diane von Furstenberg dresses. Even the company’s most traditional of deal makers, the former vice chairman James B. Lee Jr. — known for his slicked-back hair and business shirts with white collars and cuffs — directed his bankers to dress in hoodies during the run-up to Facebook’s initial public offering of stock.Do not expect bankers to switch out their hand-tailored suits for worn denim at their next meeting with a titan of industry as a matter of course, however. The memo specifies that employees should “dress for that client” — which still gives deal makers some sartorial leeway if they are meeting with, say, a technology entrepreneur used to wearing hoodies and sneakers.And denim generally isn’t considered appropriate, unless the employee has permission to wear it.Employees at bank branches still need to wear specific Chase apparel, unless the managers have specifically allowed otherwise.",business
"Last week, the Parisian gallerist Almine Rech announced that her son, Paul de Froment, will be the director of her forthcoming New York outpost. The news brought to mind another recent opening: Lisson’s New York gallery, where the second-generation dealer Alex Logsdail serves as the international director. His father, the British art dealer Nicholas Logsdail, co-founded Lisson in 1967, brought Alex into the business in 2009 and made him director in 2011. Logsdail and Rech are not alone: many major players, including David Zwirner, Arne Glimcher and Sean Kelly, have made room for their children in their businesses.Image Nicholas (left) and Alex Logsdail in 2015. Credit Roberto ChamorroAs the son of Arne Glimcher — the dealer who nurtured the careers of Robert Rauschenberg and Jean Dubuffet — Pace president Marc Glimcher now effectively runs his father’s international gallery. Schooled in molecular biology and immunology, Marc initially stayed away from the gallery at his father’s request, but found himself habitually returning. “At some point, if your parent is Arne Glimcher or Paula Cooper or Rudolf Zwirner, you have to confront two things. You have to come to peace with the idea that you’re going to do the same thing that your father did, and your father was pretty great at it,” Marc says. “You also have to come to grips with the fact that he started it from scratch and you are never going to do that. It’s an internal struggle that took me 20 years to untangle.”Marc had to call in his longtime friend, Matthew Marks, to vouch for him, but eventually convinced Arne. “When my children were little, I said I’d support them with anything but coming into Pace,” Arne says. “If anything, Marc did this in spite of me. He has very much his own identity, and I feel at this point that I work for Marc more than he works for me. I’m very privileged.” Marc’s first assignment, a book on Picasso’s sketchbooks, eventually led him to start a publishing house of his own, called Second Sons.",business
"While Ms. Levenstien’s early success was funded by cash flow — she has produced 15 bacon and beer events, as well as beer-themed events at several zoos and lower-key events like river tubing in Indiana — she is thinking about her next options. One has been searching for partners, like the stadiums where the San Francisco 49ers and the Denver Broncos play.“It’s a lot of work and a lot of risk to go to another city,” she said. “So new venues have joined us as partners. They guide us on what we do. It made us a much more seamless event so we’re don’t say, ‘We didn’t sell tickets and now we’re on the hook for $70,000.’ ”Jimmy Bernstein, the chief executive of Howl at the Moon, a chain of live-music bars, said he opened the first 10 locations using cash flow but the cost of each one slowed how fast he could grow.About a decade ago, he brought in investors who have allowed him to focus on running the business, while supplying him with the capital to open new locations. He credited that partnership with helping him to continue building his business when a Seattle location failed in 2006, costing him $1.1 million.“They said, ‘Fail fast and move on,’ ” he said. “I set my sights on the next project, which was very exciting. It all came back to where it was before.”Yet partners can only go so far. Jim McCann, founder and executive chairman of 1-800-Flowers, bought his first flower shop on First Avenue in Manhattan 40 years ago. And then, for 10 years, he said, he opened a new flower shop every six months, giving the store managers an ownership stake in each one.In 1998, in the middle of the boom in internet initial public offerings, he said executives at AOL mentioned to him that he could grow more quickly if he took his company public. In late 1999, the company did just that, right before the markets began to cool.",business
"Calls for greater boardroom diversity are nothing new. Yet the business group’s recommendation carries special weight. This is no academic exercise; it’s the view of C-Suite leaders. The recommendation is likely to add significant momentum to the push for board diversity. It may also prompt a retooled director nomination process based on a much broader consideration of requisite backgrounds and experience.For many nominating committees, this may require something of a “midcourse correction.” For many years, the nomination focus has been on building the competency-based board — in other words, nominating candidates with specific skills that are heavy on industry background and experience or possess backgrounds in other types of leadership positions that are directly related to the company’s business. The governance expectation was that more precise competencies would enhance the exercise of informed oversight and decision-making, in support of the long-term success of the organization. The Business Roundtable, however, adopts a much more expansive view of “competency.”This new recommendation is grounded in three basic themes:First, the relevant data indicates that despite recent improvements, women and minorities remain underrepresented on corporate boards, a trend that is likely to continue given the current rate of appointment. Second, there is a growing recognition that companies benefit generally from an environment that promotes diversity in backgrounds and perspectives. This, even though there is no broad agreement as to whether greater boardroom diversity directly results in improved corporate financial performance. “Differing perspectives and maintaining respect for the individual enable Americans, as well as American corporations, to prosper.” And last, the association’s executives believe that inclusion of talented women and minorities in the boardroom and leadership team is increasingly essential to competing in a diverse global marketplace.For some prominent companies, this is yesterday’s news. For example, General Motors recently became the first major industrial corporation to achieve an even split of men and women on its governing board. This is particularly notable given the traditional nature of the automotive industry as male-dominated. In addition, a recent study by the executive data firm Equilar tracks perceptible progress among boards of companies on the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index in reaching gender diversity. Yet, even the most casual observer would admit that broad-based progress has been elusive. Entire forests have been cleared in support of surveys, reports, analyses and position papers criticizing the lack of ethnic and general diversity in boardrooms.It should also be noted that the “Commonsense Corporate Governance Principles,” released this summer by a group that included Warren E. Buffett and Jamie Dimon, among other corporate chieftains, weighed in on the subject. It characterized “diversity along multiple dimensions” as essential to effective governance, and encouraged the nomination process to draw from a “rigorously diverse pool.” But the diversity references made in those principles were neither discussed, nor externally promoted, to the same extent as were those of the Business Roundtable.",business
"Put another away, if journalism is the first draft of history, Twitter is the first draft of journalism.The nation’s founders recognized the importance of speedy dissemination of news when they provided for low postal rates for newspaper subscribers and allowed newspaper printers to mail one another newspapers without charge. The content of many newspapers consisted mostly of reprints of articles obtained from these exchanges. In the same way, links in tweets serve as an indispensable guide to the best of journalism that originates outside of Twitter.So who better to rescue Twitter than Mr. Page, a founder of the company dedicated to organizing the world’s information? Twitter takes the first cut of doing that organizing, in real time.Mr. Page also commands an empire built on algorithms. And Twitter has a pressing need for better algorithms to keep the platform free of the sludge discharged by racists, anti-Semites and other trolls.The Anti-Defamation League, in a recent study, counted 2.6 million tweets with anti-Semitic language in a year, but despite Twitter’s disavowal of “hateful conduct,” the league found, only 21 percent of the anti-Semitic accounts were suspended. Twitter relies on humans, not software, for enforcement, and they are overwhelmed.This computer-science problem — filtering out trolls — remains as difficult as any of the moonshots being tackled in Alphabet’s Google X division. If Mr. Page developed a way to help Twitter keep the hate speech out, that technology would not only win back the advertisers who are fleeing because of trolls, but also, if shared, enable newspapers to reopen their comments’ sections at their own websites, promoting the airing of differing views in public space. What service to the public could surpass that?While I’m offering Mr. Page unsolicited advice about what he should do with his money, I’ll also note that Twitter’s current market capitalization, of around $12 billion, is a triumph of hope over reality. If Twitter’s revenue and user growth fail to surge, the asking price will fall. Look at Yahoo: Eight years ago, the company spurned an acquisition offer from Microsoft for more than $45 billion. This year, it accepted an offer from Verizon for about a tenth of that.",business
"Pedestrians jam the Rue Vieille du Temple, a main drag that once led to the Templar fortress, to ogle handbags in two Chanel pop-up stores that opened in a 17th-century mansion, the Hôtel Amelot de Bisseuil. At the entrance, ancient wood doors carved with Medusa masks have been updated with cherry-red lacquer. Rainbow-hued shoe and watch shops jostle with chocolatiers and boutiques offering $120 perfumed candles. Farther north, the Haut Marais is honeycombed with galleries, from the hip-hop displays at the Galerie Perrotin to the open space of the Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac.While the makeover of the Marais has drawn big business, the change hasn’t been lost on its residents. Butchers, bakers and tailors have been replaced almost entirely by chain boutiques. Near the Rue des Rosiers, the gentrified Jewish district where boutiques are overtaking Judaica shops and delis, an Izod Lacoste store stands in a former boulangerie: The buzz was that the company offered madame, the owner, a sum that allowed her to retire immediately.The Marais is hardly the only area of Paris facing change. Today, the city is in the midst of an ambitious expansion project called Le Grand Paris, which aims to enlarge Paris’s boundaries by stitching its core to the banlieues — the neglected outer suburbs — with a new transport system. Major roads, including parts of the Rue de Rivoli, the quarter’s main thoroughfare, may eventually close to traffic to make the center pedestrian and environmentally friendly. Pioneering architecture, like the glass canopy at Les Halles and the bubble curves of the Fondation Louis Vuitton, keeps transforming the cityscape.For the Marais, the crowds testify to a rebirth. The first Golden Age came in the early 17th century, nearly 500 years after the Templars cleared vast marshland — or marais, in French — to enlarge their domain. When King Henry IV set up at what is now the Place des Vosges in 1604, the aristocracy followed, building the sumptuous mansions that imbue the area with glamour today. After the French court later moved to the Tuileries Palace, the Marais deteriorated for nearly two centuries and was almost razed until the government protected it in 1964.It is these traces of history that I follow on my walks, dipping in and out of the quarter’s ancient charms, perhaps pausing for a glass of wine, handcrafted tea or a raspberry meringue at a clutch of mod cafes and pâtisseries that have followed the retail influx.",business
"On the regulatory landscape, no issue has been more debated over the last few years than the Labor Department’s fiduciary rule. Regardless of its uncertain fate under the new administration, the industry has already committed significant resources to instill greater accountability and best practices around advice delivery.Even if the rule is repealed, the Securities and Exchange Commission, perhaps in conjunction with Finra, is said to be contemplating its own proposal of new regulations that reconcile standards for retirement and nonretirement accounts.Some firms have said they will not backtrack on steps they had begun to put into effect in anticipation of narrow compliance with the Labor Department’s fiduciary rule. The direction has already been set. Attempts to provide greater transparency and eliminate potential conflicts should proceed and should apply beyond retirement accounts. The investor experience and the professionalism of our industry will be enhanced to the benefit of everyone.Combined, these forces are fueling a move toward more scalable, technology-enabled, customized investment advice that is tied to an investor’s unique goals. Firms are investing heavily in an advice-centric ecosystem with enhanced wealth management services and digital delivery tools. They are developing increasingly sophisticated approaches linking financial planning with portfolio construction and continuing management in a single end-to-end process. Legacy systems are being retooled or retired, and advisory programs that exist in separate silos are being consolidated to deliver a simpler, more cohesive investor experience.In the future, the need for investment advice will increase. This next phase of evolution in financial advice delivery promises important benefits for all investors — specifically, greater access to professional investment management through lower minimums and new engagement models, lower-cost solutions and a focus on personal goals.The advice industry also stands to benefit. The automation of routine processes will provide the efficiency and scale necessary to serve more investors — and important, the time to focus on the interpersonal elements of the adviser-investor relationship that cannot be replicated by technology.The industry needs to recognize the drivers of change and take full advantage of the opportunities they present to enable expanded access to professional financial advice, increased levels of transparency and efficiency and a shared alignment of interests among firms, advisers and investors.",business

You want to make nice with the president because you’re a public company and you have shareholders, and it’s hard to balance doing the right financial thing versus doing what they think is the right thing, whatever your political beliefs are.”Mr. Cuban, the billionaire investor and star of the reality TV show “Shark Tank,” has been engaged in a running Twitter feud with Mr. Trump. In the latest volley, the president tweeted that Mr. Cuban “backed me big-time but I wasn’t interested in taking all of his calls,” and “He’s not smart enough to run for president!”A Trump invitation “has become a double-edged sword because the population is so divided,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who organizes meetings of chief executives there.",business

"It’s tricky enough pinning down business leaders to work with your administration.

The company had already been attacked — unfairly, many staff members believed — for giving rides to airport customers in New York during protests against Mr. Trump’s immigration order. Employees were also disturbed by Mr. Kalanick’s willingness to advise the president.His experience also illustrates how it is difficult for corporate chieftains to strike a balance between staying in the administration’s good graces and thinking about their workers, many of whom might be immigrants themselves.Even as Mr. Kalanick leaves, though, Stephen A.

"For devotees of President Trump, the first gathering on Friday of his business council, which featured 17 executives, may have looked like a colorized version of “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” but for those focusing exclusively on the rapport between the two leaders, it resembled “Goodfellas.”Sitting alongside Mr. Trump was the head of the council, Stephen Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity firm Blackstone Group, wearing Washington’s newly obligatory red tie. Since its founding in 1985, Blackstone has accumulated more than $361 billion in assets and made Mr. Schwartzman a fortune estimated at $11 billion — a figure that no doubt dwarfs whatever it is that Mr. Trump is worth. In 2015, Mr. Schwarzman was paid $799 million.Mr. Schwarzman has flourished during the four decades that the people Mr. Trump purports to represent have languished. In the pursuit once known as leveraged buyouts — before some marketing genius fastened on “private equity” as a way to disguise the fact that the business still rests on a mountain of debt — Mr. Schwarzman and his brethren have become symbols for the economic inequality that Mr. Trump deplored during his campaign. They are able to borrow billions and deduct interest payments from their corporate tax bills while $75,000-a-year wage earners in Ohio, Michigan or Pennsylvania are unable to secure a mortgage and get no tax break on their monthly rent.Just like Mr. Trump’s real-estate business, groups like Blackstone rely on enormous debt to prop up their business. The playbook for any of their acquisitions is to gain 100 percent control by financing the purchase of a company with a small down payment and a heap of debt secured not (heaven forbid) by their own savings or houses, but by the business they are looking to acquire. They then cut costs — which almost always means making sizable layoffs at the company they’re taking over — and figure out a way to reward themselves financially.",business

"I gathered with other black residents of Tulsa, Okla., last Wednesday night outside the county courthouse to hear a disappointing yet predictable verdict: Betty Shelby had been found not guilty of first-degree manslaughter in the police killing of Terence Crutcher.Ms. Shelby, who is white, shot and killed Mr. Crutcher, who was black, during the course of a routine traffic stop in September 2016. Mr. Crutcher was unarmed, but Ms. Shelby said she shot because she feared for her life when she saw him reach into his car. In what has become a familiar pattern when law enforcement officers are accused of deadly misconduct, she walked free.Once news of the decision spread among the crowd gathered outside, the small band of Shelby supporters disbanded and scurried off. Mr. Crutcher’s parents and sister walked out of the courthouse with their heads bowed. The lawyers for the Crutcher family visibly bristled, perhaps with a sense of helplessness, or with nagging regret that they could have perhaps done more. And those of us who had been waiting outside sat stultified, unable to feel surprise.The next day, Chuck Jordan, the Tulsa police chief, offered little solace, simply announcing that Officer Shelby’s employment was being “evaluated.” Mayor G. T. Bynum addressed a roomful of journalists at City Hall, recalling that black Tulsans long have been the victims of “lawlessness and violence” and delivering a painful reminder that “Tulsans have talked about addressing racial disparity for 100 years but haven’t succeeded.”",business
"The lack of closets in new chains like Moxy, a Marriott spinoff now open in New Orleans and Tempe, Ariz., reflects research showing that guests often do not bother to unpack anymore, said Mr. Suomi, who designed the New Orleans hotel. The bureau-less rooms also demonstrate that dresser drawers are now seen as liabilities. “They’re just one more place for a guest to leave something behind and then the hotel has to send it to them.”But there is another reason closets are becoming scarce at niche brands like Moxy, whose average room rate is $244 a night, and Vib, an ultramodern offshoot of Best Western that will open its first three locations this year in Staten Island, Chicago and Springfield, Mo.“A room can start to feel pretty small when you put a closet and a dresser in,” said Ron Pohl, the chief operations officer and senior vice president for Best Western.But the feeling of smallness in modern guest rooms may be less the fault of closets than of the fact that they are actually shrinking. Guest rooms that were 350 square feet five years ago at what Mr. Suomi called the big three business hotels, Regency, Hilton and Marriott, are now often 275 square feet, he said. That, too, is a response to evidence that time is mostly spent elsewhere. Guest rooms at the new boutique hotels like Moxy and Vib are even smaller, he said, averaging about 200 square feet.That leaves little space for traditional furnishings. But it paves the way for designs like the one at Moxy, which encourages guests to manage their own spaces by hanging almost every piece of furniture on the wall, Shaker-style, and the one at Vib, which will offer platform beds so suitcases can be stowed underneath.Among the furnishings hanging from hooks at Moxy are small tables that double as desks, Mr. Suomi said. “People still want them,” he said.Desks will be in every Vib room, too. “We were never in support of removing desks from guest rooms,” Mr. Pohl said. “But the desk area will double with some drawer space at Vib.”",business
"I have interviewed many such people. Renée Martin was thrown into an unaffordable high-risk pool because of an abnormal Pap smear. Lisa Solod got turned away by four insurers because she was on thyroid replacement, an asthma inhaler and hormones — a not uncommon trifecta for women in their 50s. Wanda Wickizer was priced out of having insurance because she had taken Lexapro for depression. Jesse Albert found that he and his family were uninsurable because he had once had a benign skin cancer and a bout of hepatitis C, even though his immune system had cleared the virus.“Insurers each drew a line in the sand that was invisible for conditions they didn’t want to cover,” said Jean P. Hall, the director of the Institute for Health and Disability Policy Studies at the University of Kansas. “We didn’t even know where that line was because it was considered proprietary information.”Turning away people with just a hint of illness is a reasonable business strategy. But as so often occurs in the profit-oriented health system, what is best for business is not necessarily good for patients.When the House Committee on Energy and Commerce studied insurance denials and exclusions for pre-existing conditions by the four largest for-profit insurers in 2010, it found plentiful evidence that “each company had business plans that relied on using pre-existing conditions to limit the amount of money paid for medical claims.” In documents reviewed by the committee, one company listed “improved pre-existing exclusion processes” as an opportunity to increase growth.The committee report found that the insurance companies turned down one out of every seven applicants with pre-existing conditions. Such denials had jumped by nearly 50 percent between 2007 and 2009, as the apparently successful financial strategy gained sway.",business
"The people around Mr. Trump obviously do. General McMaster’s phrase, “dignity and self-determination for the Palestinians,” was borrowed from Mr. Abbas. At the Aipac conference, Mr. Pence added that the administration was “also invested in finding an equitable and just solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” On “Meet the Press,” Secretary Tillerson denied that an embassy move could be separate from an overall peace initiative.As for Mr. Mattis, his views have hardly been hidden. “I paid a military security price every day as the commander of Centcom because the Americans were seen as biased in support of Israel,” he said in 2013, adding that “moderate Arabs who want to be with us” could not “come out publicly in support of people who don’t show respect for the Arab Palestinians.” Foreign Policy magazine reported, meanwhile, that the State Department is discreetly proposing a 5 percent raise in aid to the Palestinian Authority, to $215 million.In advance of his trip, Mr. Trump has seemed uncharacteristically disciplined in the balancing act he’s expected to perform. An agreement, he told reporters in Mr. Abbas’s presence, “cannot be imposed by the United States, or by any other nation.” That reaffirmed a longstanding Netanyahu position and implied that Mr. Abbas should negotiate without preconditions and without an assurance that the United States would pressure Israel. But then Mr. Trump added, “I will do whatever is necessary to facilitate the agreement — to mediate, to arbitrate anything they’d like to do.” The next day, General McMaster appointed to his national security team Air Force Col. Kris Bauman, who had proposed security arrangements for both sides in 2013.Mr. Abbas must find President Trump’s inconsistency and reversion to mogul banalities a relief. His people reportedly proposed to Mr. Trump’s people, businesslike, that new talks with Israel could start where Mr. Abbas and Mr. Netanyahu’s predecessor, Ehud Olmert, broke off in 2008, having covered most major issues — security, borders, Jerusalem and refugees — and leaving potentially bridgeable gaps. Nor did Mr. Abbas miss the chance for some tactical flattery, telling Mr. Trump that with his “great negotiating ability,” peace was possible.Mr. Netanyahu cannot feel equally sanguine. Many have questioned whether Mr. Abbas can survive a new round of peacemaking. Mr. Netanyahu may be wondering whether the administration is inadvertently threatening his fragile coalition. And Mr. Abbas made clear to Mr. Olmert that any Palestinian conception of two states entailed a capital in East Jerusalem and international arrangements for the Holy Basin.The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Saudis and the Emiratis have been discussing an interim plan “aimed in part at aligning them with Mr. Trump” that would establish direct telecommunications links with Israel, allow overflight rights to Israeli aircraft and lift restrictions on some trade — but only if Israel froze settlements outside the large blocks along the Green Line and eased Gaza’s commercial quarantine. Any of these concessions would cause hard-line ministers on the Israeli right to bolt, though they are acceptable to Netanyahu’s rivals in the opposition.Mr. Netanyahu, to be sure, still has powerful Republican allies like Senator Lindsey Graham and the casino tycoon Sheldon Adelson. And Mr. Trump has not encountered them pushing back — yet.But one thing is clear. The administration is operating from an emerging logic that could well appeal to many more Republicans and a great many Democrats as well. President Trump has said he wants the “ultimate deal,” and the people around him — who may well outlast him — do, too.",business
"When President Trump sets off on his first international trip as president on Friday, his itinerary will include two Middle Eastern countries, Israel and Saudi Arabia, where he explored business deals before taking office.In Israel, Mr. Trump has long sought a tower project in Tel Aviv. But he has shelved that ambition for now, given his self-imposed ban on foreign deals during his presidency and the appearances of embarking on such a venture while attempting to broker peace in the region. In Saudi Arabia, his executives scouted a hotel deal in recent years, but opted not to move forward.Before his inauguration, Mr. Trump handed his business, the Trump Organization, over to his eldest sons and his executives. But even with that distance, Mr. Trump continues to be the face of the company that bears his name, adding an unusual dimension to his foreign tours and diplomatic outreach — with the potential that he could return again as a businessman. In fact, Mr. Trump has registered or applied for a number of trademarks in both Israel and Saudi Arabia in the last decade, according to a review of international trademark databases, in categories that cover both potential real estate development projects and consumer goods.",business
"Mr. Thompson unconvincingly asserts that Facebook’s power over publishers produces a “dead weight loss” (where monopoly taxation leads to a waste of resources) and that consumers are afflicted by Facebook’s stifling of innovation. But Facebook users are not suffering under the yoke of oppressive masters. On the contrary, they are benefiting from a period of intense competition.The same applies when it comes to entertainment. Netflix isn’t one of the big five, but it enjoyed a brief honeymoon as a monopoly after it crushed Blockbuster. But just a few years later, it faces intense competition around the globe. While the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, may say that “sleep” is his company’s major rival, in reality, Amazon and Alphabet — not to mention Hulu, HBO and myriad local players — prevent Netflix from running away with the market.Commentators often conflate ubiquity, or narrow market dominance, with a broad-based monopoly. Amazon regularly gets tarred with this brush. About 80 million people now take a Prime subscription bundle, according to industry estimates. Weaving together multiple products and services under one compelling offering gives Amazon a formidable advantage to which its rivals are scrambling to react. But even so, Amazon is so far only exhibiting signs of market dominance in the market for books. And even there, as Paul Krugman has noted, it looks more like a monopsonist exerting market power than a monopolist exploiting consumers.For diapers, dog food, videos, music, cloud-computing services, voice technology and so forth — it faces extreme competition from other tech companies, not to mention traditional retailers. Walmart alone is still four times its size in retail (albeit much smaller online). In video and music, Amazon is an order of magnitude smaller than Netflix and Spotify. And in cloud computing, Amazon faces serious competition from Alphabet and Microsoft and others, which offer similar services, also on a grand scale.It is blindingly obvious that traditional retailers are suffering. But holding Amazon responsible for the decline in brick-and-mortar retail is like blaming Craigslist for the death of print classifieds. The natural gravitational pull of the internet caused those problems, not one company.While almost all of the hand-wringing about tech monopolies is overblown. The player that perhaps warrants the closest scrutiny today is Alphabet, and in particular its Google search engine.Google’s overwhelming dominance of search (it has 90 percent market share in United States search revenue) is particularly critical given search’s centrality to the web’s commercial ecosystem. Google, however, has not been sensitive enough in handling its power — especially with its history of bringing the fight to smaller, narrowly focused rivals, like Yelp in the local reviews market. Its strategy in certain verticals resembles the old survival maxim: First, eat what the monkey eats, then eat the monkey.",business
"Despite his reliance on the analysis of huge troves of data to develop and support his theories, in the concluding chapters, Mr. West makes a compelling argument against the “arrogance and narcissism” reflected in the growing fetishization of “big data” in itself. “Data for data’s sake,” he argues, “or the mindless gathering of big data, without any conceptual framework for organizing and understanding it, may actually be bad or even dangerous.”In presenting his own provocative and fascinating conceptual framework, Mr. West manages to deliver a lot of theory and history accessibly and entertainingly. Yet it is not clear whether that framework is robust enough to be applied productively to the business realm as he attempts to do.Mr. West concedes early on that the strength of mathematical correlations on which he relies decreases as he moves from the biological to the urban to the corporate. Until relatively recently, Mr. West was unable to get funding to access a database of historical corporate information. At one point during the book, he actually seems to blame this challenge for the particularly thin results in this domain. The problems with his analysis of the business sector, however, may be more systemic.First, it is at least questionable whether the constantly shifting hierarchal network structures of corporate organizations are consistent with the three fundamental characteristics of networks upon which his framework is based. Notably, a wide range of behavioral economics research, grounded in the pioneering work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, suggests that the optimization requirement is not likely to be met.Furthermore, the consistent “decay” rates of corporations identified by Mr. West — calculated by the longevity of independent public corporations over time — does not correspond to any consistent change in underlying activity analogous to “death” in living organisms. Even in the context of bankruptcy, which Mr. West looks at separately from corporate “death” from mergers and acquisitions, good businesses with bad capital structures often continue “life” under new corporate form. It is not evident how meaningful mathematical calculations could be that treat such situations the same as failed businesses that are simply liquidated in bankruptcy for scrap value.That “Scale” fails to realize the full promise of its title does not diminish the magnitude of its actual contribution and insight. In the 16th century, Francois Rabelais, a French scholar, admonished that “science without conscience is the ruin of the soul.”Mr. West’s warning that big data without a theoretical framework is the ruin of science is an important contemporary corollary caution that “Scale” will hopefully establish for the next generation of scholars.",business
"President Trump faces a choice that will echo across his presidency and beyond: whether to remain in the Paris climate agreement. Although most Americans, his own secretaries of state and energy, and heads of state from around the globe are urging the president to stay, he remains undecided. Let us hope that a newly invigorated pro-Paris campaign by many of America’s top C.E.O.s will sway him.In a recent barrage of public letters and full-page ads, Fortune 100 companies are voicing strong support for remaining in the Paris accord. The breadth of this coalition is remarkable: industries from oil and gas to retail, mining, utilities, agriculture, chemicals, information and automotive. This is as close as big business gets to a consensus position.American business leaders understand that remaining in the agreement would spur new investment, strengthen American competitiveness, create jobs, ensure American access to global markets and help reduce future business risks associated with the changing climate. Leaving Paris would yield the opposite.Our companies are best served by a stable and predictable international framework that commits all nations to climate-change mitigation. The Paris agreement overcame one of the longest-standing hurdles to international climate negotiations: getting the developing world, including China and India, onboard. If America backs away now, decades of diplomatic progress could be jeopardized.",business
"The man seated across from me had been a spy for the United States for several decades. Recruited by a C.I.A. officer, this man, at great risk to his and his family’s lives, had provided critically important intelligence that formed the basis of innumerable raw intelligence reports, some of which found their way into the President’s Daily Brief.We met because he wanted to tell me something. With tears in his eyes, he explained that he was drawn to work for us by the idea of America — that America stood for justice, decency and freedom and against tyranny, oppression and injustice. He said that he agreed to divulge critical secrets about his government’s leaders and his country’s capacities — not because the agency had compromising material on him (it did not) and not for money (he was paid, but not much), but because he believed in America.This man’s story is hardly unique. Many people agree to become spies for the C.I.A. because they see a stark difference between our ideals and the repressive and brutal regimes of their own countries.A friend told me recently about one of his best recruits, a full-fledged member of a terrorist organization. This person was captivated by the prospect that after his days of spying against terrorists were over, he might be able go to the United States and pursue the American dream. He, too, viewed America as embracing the world’s downtrodden and dispossessed, not their oppressors, and offering everyone the opportunity to succeed.",business
"Here’s one of the surest routes for men to think of women as equals: Have a daughter.In Silicon Valley, the venture capitalists who invest in tech start-ups are significantly more likely to hire a female investing partner if the hiring partners have daughters, according to a new study by researchers at Harvard. Having mixed-gender teams in turn improved venture capital firms’ financial performance — providing rare quantifiable evidence of the business benefits of diversity.The influence of daughters is consistent with previous research that shows that fathers of daughters support more egalitarian gender roles, and that male lawmakers, judges and corporate executives with daughters are more likely to support gender equity and policies that benefit women.Even men who play traditional gender roles in their personal lives tend to want their daughters to be independent and high-achieving, research has found. Having daughters seems to make them more aware of sexism or expose them to challenges different from their own. Ivanka Trump, for example, has done this in at least one way, by encouraging her father to include a paid parental leave policy in his new White House budget.“If I’m an old white male, I perhaps wouldn’t go out of my way to associate with young females,” said Maya Sen, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. “But if I have a daughter, I do come into contact with her and her friends, so it breaks the flocking with like-minded people.” Ms. Sen was not involved in the new study, but found in a previous study that judges, particularly Republican ones, were more likely to vote in favor of women on issues like sex discrimination if they had daughters.",business
"The week I graduated from high school, a teacher presented me with a gift: a silver Cross pen engraved with my name. I was surprised and touched. I hadn’t felt particularly close to this teacher, who had instructed me in Advanced Placement history and government courses. But I did well on the A.P. exams. He felt pride in my accomplishment, and the gift was his way of expressing that.When I arrived at college, I kept the fancy pen in its box in my desk and took it out only on exam days. As I scrawled in blue books, the pen provided a reminder of past success — and a small boost in confidence. I thought of it as my lucky exam pen.It turns out campuses abound with good-luck charms. In informal surveys, a former Connecticut College professor, Stuart Vyse, found that 62 percent of college students reported using a lucky pen or wearing a special piece of jewelry or clothing to exams. Fifty-four percent tried to sit in the same seat for tests, and 38 percent listened to a favorite pre-exam song. When Lauren Block, a professor at Baruch College’s Zicklin School of Business, was an undergraduate, she wore a lucky pair of Nike sneakers to her exams, and she performed so well that her roommate began borrowing them to wear to big tests, too.Do lucky objects actually help us perform better? If we believe in their special power, research suggests that they can. Professor Block has done experiments in which students prepared for an exam with a study guide used by a previous student. Some students were shown the grade point averages and exam scores of the people who had previously studied from the guide, and the research found that those relying on a guidebook previously used by a high performer tended to do better than others.",business
"Here’s the clincher: The doodle can’t pull it off. He thinks that sticking a feather in his cap will suffice to join Britain’s most effete club. In reality, he needs an elaborate costume. The subtext — actually, it might just be the text — is that this quintessential American is a homosexual so daft that he can’t even demonstrate his homosexuality.O.K., it’s the 1770s. It’s war. You expected nice?Unfortunately for the British, the Americans started winning the war. And the more the Americans won, the more they embraced “Yankee Doodle” as their own. By the time the Battle of Bunker Hill rolled round, in June 1775, the Continental Army had the song in heavy rotation. After a clinching victory at the Battle of Saratoga, in September 1777, the Americans were serenading their defeated foes with “Yankee Doodle.” This was pure agony for the British, as an English officer named Thomas Aubrey reported.“ ‘Yankee Doodle’ is now their paean, a favorite of favorites, played in their army, esteemed as warlike as the ‘Grenadiers’ march — it is the lover’s spell, the nurse’s lullaby,” he wrote. “It was not a little mortifying to hear them play this tune, when their army marched down to our surrender.”What American soldiers had done would later become known as reappropriation. It is the act of embracing a name, a term, an idea — or a song — that was intended as derogatory. At minimum, the hug neutralizes the mockery. At most, it disarms an opponent of a weapon.History is filled with examples. “Tory” and “Whig” were originally scornful appellations, as was “Impressionist,” which was lifted from a critic who dismissed the movement’s paintings as “fleeting impressions.” More recently, “queer” had the bite of a rattler until gays around the world adopted and thus defanged it.But Americans are surely the maestros of reappropriation. Conservatives turned the phrase “vast right-wing conspiracy” from an accusation to a punch line. Liberals turned “Obamacare” from a sneer to an endorsement.Pop stars like Madonna and Britney Spears made “bitch” a compliment. “Redneck” has a hint of pride these days, thanks largely to Southern comedians like Jeff Foxworthy who made it a touchstone of their identities and routines. Soon after Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton a “nasty woman” during a debate, the phrase began appearing on her supporters’ T-shirts.In short, reappropriation is an American specialty — a rhetorical stratagem practiced even before the Declaration of Independence was signed. So by singing “Yankee Doodle” you’re not just celebrating the country’s birth. You are belting out words used by the soldiers who made that birth possible, and with a taunt that boomeranged for the ages.",business
"The second is antitrust. When Standard Oil, in the early 1900s, controlled 90 percent of oil refinery capacity in the United States, the federal government used its antitrust power to break it up into more than 30 smaller companies. A similar breakup was imposed 70 years later on AT&T.Still, there is a problem with traditional antitrust policy when looked at through the lens of network externalities: It focuses only on consumers’ benefits from competition. But consumers love Google and Facebook since they do not pay a dime for their services.What many users do not fully appreciate is that they do pay for these services, in the form of very valuable information. And those who appreciate this cost have no choice: There is no major search engine that does not store our past searches or collect information on our activities, and there is no significant social media platform that does not retain our preferences. That is the cost of using these technologies. Lack of competition also means lack of choice, which is ultimately lack of freedom. But what can be done?For a 21st-century problem, we suggest a 21st-century solution: a reallocation of property rights via legislation to provide more incentives to compete. In fact, the idea is not new. Patent law, for example, attributes the right to an invention to the company a scientist works for, to motivate companies to invest in research and development. Similarly, in the mobile industry, most countries have established that a cellphone number belongs to a customer, not the mobile phone provider. This redefinition of property rights (in jargon called “number portability”) makes it easier to switch carriers, fostering competition by other carriers and reducing prices for consumers.The same is possible in the social network space. It is sufficient to reassign to each customer the ownership of all the digital connections that she creates — what is known as a “social graph.” If we owned our own social graph, we could sign into a Facebook competitor — call it MyBook — and, through that network, instantly reroute all our Facebook friends’ messages to MyBook, as we reroute a phone call.",business
"Stephen Barth, a lawyer and professor of hospitality law at the University of Houston, said difficulties often arose from incidents abroad because the legal responsibilities were not clear, even to experts. Workers’ compensation laws in the United States do not always protect employees once they leave the country, unlike in Britain, where the Corporate Manslaughter Act “clarifies the responsibility of employers if an employee is put in harm’s way,” he said.At a recent Global Travel Risk Summit in Chicago, a series of programs were aimed at helping organizations develop safe travel policies. In one, teams of travel managers played out dealing with hypothetical disruptions, like the right time to evacuate during a tsunami, the legal ramifications when an employee becomes paralyzed in a serious crash while using a shared car service or what to do if an employee is kidnapped.Mr. Barth is the founder of HospitalityLawyer.com, which provides legal, safety and security resources for the industry and sponsored the meeting with the BTN Group, a business travel research firm. He said many travelers thought risks involved only extreme situations and did not realize that everyday occurrences could be just as deadly. After a traveler has flown all night with little or no sleep, having to drive on a different side of the street than in the home country “is very high risk,” he said.Many problems can be prevented or managed with minor precautions, like learning about a foreign country in advance and obtaining travel insurance coverage.There has been a steady increase since 2012 in the number of Americans buying insurance for international trips, for emergency medical care, medical evacuation and repatriation in the case of a political event or act of God, according to the travel insurance comparison website Squaremouth. But many still do not realize the need, experts say.“It’s a misconception that credit cards will cover” most medical needs abroad, said Chris Carnicelli, chief executive of Generali Global Assistance. For many travelers, he added, buying supplemental coverage has “not been top of mind.”The industry trend, Mr. Carnicelli said, is to make policies easier to understand and provide coverage “more tailored toward individual travel needs.” Identify theft protection, for example, is increasingly important in some countries.",business
"My mother was three months away from graduating when soldiers opened fire on her and other students at the National University of El Salvador. It was June 1980, several months into the Salvadoran civil war, and the military believed that students were aiding guerrilla fighters. My mother fled the attack past wounded classmates and blood-spattered walls, shaken but unharmed. The school closed. The war lasted 12 more years.By the time it ended, my mother and my father were residents of the United States on their way to citizenship. My father, who was in his second year of college when the National University closed, had been studying to be an industrial engineer. My mother was training to be a clinical psychologist. But in their new home, my father worked odd jobs and eventually landed a gig managing medical supplies at the U.C.L.A. My mother cleaned Bel-Air mansions until she died of breast cancer in 2008.You can imagine my family’s joy when I was accepted at Stanford in 2011, and their pride when I graduated four years later. The knowledge of how hard they worked, and how far we had come, brought tears to my eyes frequently over my graduation weekend.There was no more special way to honor them than by participating in Nuestra Graduación, the separate graduation ceremony for Latino students at Stanford, a tradition that was started in the 1970s.",business
"In the small indigenous town where I grew up, substance abuse, suicide and poverty touched every family, mine included. Not far from where I lived was a three-story red-brick building that had housed a residential school until 1964.Yet my friends and I in public school were not taught about the horrors of the residential schools. Instead we memorized the order of Canada’s prime ministers, starting with Sir John A. MacDonald, and took a quiz naming every Canadian province. It’s much more comfortable to talk about that stuff. Nor did we learn that MacDonald justified the schools this way: “When the school is on the reserve, the child lives with its parents, who are savages, and though he may learn to read and write, his habits and training, mode of thought are Indian. He is simply a savage who can read and write.” In residential schools, he added, “they will acquire the habits and modes of thought of white men.”The history Canada celebrates is comfortable and one-sided. One third of non-indigenous Canadians have never heard of residential schools. In a country where half of indigenous children live in poverty, one-quarter of Canadians believe indigenous people are to blame for their circumstance. The truth is much more difficult. In order to expand Canada westward, the government displaced and confined my people — a stark contrast from the Canada so praised these days for welcoming refugees from Syria and other nations.For most of my life I saw my mother every two or three years. Visits were characterized by awkward hugs and small talk in hotel rooms. Today my mother and I have no real relationship; there are no birthday calls and no cards on Mother’s Day. The desire to be held and to know a mother’s love is a loss so deep it feels hollow.I have so much to ask my mother but I have no idea where to start. The more I educate myself about my Dene heritage, the more I find strength in our community’s resiliency. There is strength in knowing where you come from and understanding the history that led you to where you are.Learning about our past won’t change it, but mandating indigenous history in our school systems is a good start. Without an honest dialogue and recognition of this history, we will hide behind a comfortable ignorance. My hope is that on July 1, Canadians who raise their flag high in celebration will also take a minute to reflect on the loss many have faced along the way.",business

Instead, Congress would leave the failure of big financial institutions to the general bankruptcy system.If one desires to return to the Gilded Age, with a financial crisis at least once every decade, this is a splendid plan.",business

There, the tables are turned, with the son running the business so his father can just make sushi.“When I was operating Sushi Zen, it was my duty solely to keep the business afloat and keep the guests happy,” the elder Mr. Suzuki, 71, said through a translator. “In the new place, financing and management are covered by my son. I wanted to focus on training and bringing up my younger staff.”Conversations about family business succession are as complicated as families themselves, but since the businesses are usually the primary driver of wealth in the family, it is essential to have such discussions, uncomfortable or not. That doesn’t mean they go smoothly, or even happen when they should.“The business and the family are usually so intertwined,” said Karen Reynolds Sharkey, national business owner strategist at U.S. Trust, the banking company. “The business is really another member of the family as they grow up.”The Suzuki family transition has been smooth so far.

He is still in touch with some of his former colleagues, some 20 years later. Mr. Dillon wasn’t aware the property was up for sale.Taylor Fryza, who directs and acts in the park’s live shows, remembered visiting the town as a girl. “When you’re a little kid, it’s like stepping into a different world,” she said. Eventually she went to acting school in New York and returned home. She said she was not worried about the place being for sale. “You just put your best foot forward and do as many shows as you can,” she said.When it comes to the sale effort, the Donleys have displayed a little showmanship of their own. In what the family admits was largely a publicity stunt, they put the Wild West Town up for sale in last year’s Christmas catalog of Hammacher Schlemmer, where it stood out among the massage wands, radio-controlled toys and exercise gadgets. Many years earlier — in 2003 — they listed it on eBay for $12 million, though they didn’t get many serious offers then, either.And so the operation chugs along, in nostalgia mode for some of its owners. “As much as we enjoyed it, as much as we loved it, it was hard work seven days a week,” Mike Donley said, adding that the grandchildren “didn’t see that as a future for them.”Larry and Helene Donley live in a house right next to the amusement park and work on the site every day.

"Afghans avidly consume Hindi language soap operas and Bollywood films, which create a perception of India as a utopian idyll of noble friendships and relatively chaste romances where the good folks always win. Paradoxically, the physical distance between India and Afghanistan brings their people even closer in their common dislike of Pakistan, which separates them geographically.A common South Asian cultural kinship insulates relations from controversies like the burning of “waste” Qurans by the United States forces in 2012 in Bagram, or propaganda leaflets dropped last week depicting a lion (the American military) chasing a dog (the Taliban), wrapped in a flag inscribed with Islam’s holiest verse.On several occasions, on learning that I am Indian, Afghan airport security officers insisted that I pull my bags off the scanning machine since checking them would be insulting a friend. Over years of travel in Afghanistan, I encountered surliness just once, while interviewing an Afghan currency dealer for a television network. After the interview, it emerged he had mistaken me for a Pakistani. The Afghan apologized profusely and insisted on a retake.The Taliban field commanders and fighters I have met, who many assume would be hostile to India owing to the support they receive from Pakistan, display the same disdain for Pakistan and affection for India as the average Afghan. One senior Taliban official reproached me for India’s failure in 1979 to condemn the Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan. But he returned quickly to criticizing the domineering control of “Punjabis,” as Afghans disparagingly call Pakistanis.Sustaining this priceless Afghan affection for India is the fact that Indian troops have never spilled Afghan blood — not in the anti-Soviet jihad in the 1980s, nor the civil war in the 1990s, nor through the insurgency after 2002.The combat-weary Afghans associate India’s presence with Kabul’s biggest children’s hospital and medical missions in their major cities that treated hundreds of thousands until some Indian doctors who manned them were killed in Kabul in 2010.India has financed and built Afghanistan’s Parliament, Kabul’s most prestigious high school, the transmission lines that light up Kabul and the buses that ferry commuters in the capital. India funded and helped rebuild the hydroelectric Salma Dam in western Herat province. India also built a 133-mile highway linking Afghanistan to Iran.

"Adam Smith, the father of modern capitalism, envisioned financial services (and I stress the word “service”) as an industry that didn’t exist as an end in itself, but rather as a helpmeet to other types of business. Yet lending to Main Street is now a minority of what the largest banks in the country do. In the 1970s, most of their financial flows, which of course come directly from our savings, would have been funneled into new business investment. Today, only about 15 percent of the money coming out of the largest financial institutions goes to that purpose. The rest exists in a closed loop of trading; institutions facilitate and engage in the buying and selling of stocks, bonds, real estate and other assets that mainly enriches the 20 percent of the population that owns 80 percent of that asset base. This doesn’t help growth, but it does fuel the wealth gap.This fundamental shift in the business model of finance is what we should really be talking about — rather than the technocratic details of liquidity ratios or capital levels or even how to punish specific banking misdeeds. The big problem is that our banking system would no longer be recognizable to Adam Smith, who believed that for markets to work, all players must have equal access to information, transparent prices and a shared moral framework. Good luck with that today.While the largest banks can correctly claim that they have offloaded risky assets and bolstered the amount of cash on their balance sheets over the last decade, their business model has become fundamentally disconnected from the very people and entities it was designed to serve. Small community banks, which make up only 13 percent of all banking assets, do nearly half of all lending to small businesses. Big banks are about deal making. They serve mostly themselves, existing as the middle of the hourglass that is our economy, charging whatever rent they like for others to pass through. (Finance is one of the few industries in which fees have gone up as the sector as a whole has grown.) The financial industry, dominated by the biggest banks, provides only 4 percent of all jobs in the country, yet takes about a quarter of the corporate profit pie.Perhaps that’s why companies of all stripes try to copy its model. Nonfinancial firms as a whole now get five times the revenue from purely financial activities as they did in the 1980s. Stock buybacks artificially drive up the price of corporate shares, enriching the C-suite. Airlines can make more hedging oil prices than selling coach seats. Drug companies spend as much time tax optimizing as they do worrying about which new compound to research. The largest Silicon Valley firms now use a good chunk of their spare cash to underwrite bond offerings the same way Goldman Sachs might.The blending of technology and finance has reached an apex with the creation of firms like SoFi, which put the same old models on big data steroids. It’s an area we’ll likely hear much more about. A couple of weeks ago, at the Senate Banking Committee hearings on fintech, lawmakers once again struggled with how to think about these latest lending crises. But it’s not data or privacy or algorithms that are the fundamental issue with our financial system. It’s the fact that the system itself has lost its core purpose.Finance has become the tail that wags the dog. Until we start talking about how to create a financial system that really serves society, rather than just trying to stay ahead of the misdeeds of one that doesn’t, we’ll struggle in vain to bridge the gap between Wall Street and Main Street.",business
"Travel management companies believe the direct booking trend is here to stay. “Everybody has a policy, every company. But the traveler says, ‘I found a lower rate,’” said Greeley Koch, executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives.Some corporate travel managers require business travelers who make their own arrangements to alert the corporate travel department or the travel management company with an email “so somebody knows where their people are and are they booking in a compliant way from a duty-of-care standpoint,” said Michael Steiner, executive vice president of Ovation Travel Group. “Some companies say if you book direct, you are not going to be reimbursed. If you report it, you will be reimbursed.”Booking patterns vary depending on travelers’ habits and the tech tools they use. Larger corporations typically have more rules than smaller ones.Rebecca Nittolo travels for business a couple of days a week for three of the four weeks each month. An associate director of sales for Education and Training Systems International in Chapel Hill, N.C., she said she mostly booked her flights and hotels through the company travel agent. When she is on business in Chicago, she books directly with a contact at the Deer Path Inn in Lake Forest, Ill.“I work at a small company,” Ms. Nittolo said. “They always know where I am. I’m always in communication with my team.”Some corporations keep track of their travelers with Concur TripLink, which allows travel managers to capture data from every booking channel — flights, hotels and ground transportation — regardless of how business travelers have booked. There are also mobile apps that allow employees to check in with their company when they’ve landed, Mr. Rose, of iJet International, said.The three issues that business travelers are most likely to encounter are petty crime and theft, medical and health situations, and bad weather. Still, travel risk depends on where travelers are headed, the profile of the travelers, and where they are meeting and with whom, said Erin Wilk, global travel safety and security manager for Facebook and chairman of the Global Business Travel Association’s risk committee.",business
"Ms. Dong said some countries’ business dealings are more task-oriented while others are relationship-oriented. “A business partner may want to share a meal when you arrive, and you may be thinking, ‘I need to get to work,’” she said. But the social interaction during the meal may set the stage for the tasks ahead.Expert-led tours are becoming more of an option for business travelers seeking to soak up local knowledge. Context Travel, an American tour company, introduced two-hour sessions in some Asian and European cities called “Welcome to…” about three years ago. While the program was originally designed for tourists, Paul Bennett, the company’s founder, said he’s seen a significant increase in session bookings by business travelers over the past year.Each “Welcome to …” session begins with a one-hour introduction to the city and includes maps, basic phrases in the local language and cultural information based on the traveler’s needs. A neighborhood walk follows, including instruction on how to use public transportation if needed. “It sets the traveler up,” Mr. Bennett said.Recent clients booking a “Welcome to…” session included a group of American doctors coming to Shanghai for a medical conference. By learning a bit about cultural customs, local news and the history of the city, the doctors felt they could “accelerate” their conversations with their Chinese counterparts, Mr. Bennett said. They had only a few days to interact on important medical issues, and they hoped to minimize the usual introductory awkwardness and “go deeper and make the most out of their time,” he said.Each area of the world has its own particular practices. Along with personal consultations and regional support teams, the World Bank offers its employees a website with information on how to live and work effectively in 120 locations. “We do it for people coming to the U.S. to work as well,” Mr. Cowan said.Mr. Bennett, of Context, said that some of his business clients were feeling more self-conscious recently about traveling as an American abroad. The “America first” stance of the White House puts them in a defensive position when they go in to negotiate a business deal, Mr. Bennett said. “Business travelers are coming to us to learn about the culture they will be working with because they want to be viewed as partners,” he said.Mr. Udashkin, of Raden, said he liked to absorb the local culture in person. In addition to Seoul, he has traveled to Paris, Milan, London and Hong Kong in the last 18 months to show his suitcases to retailers. He said he would arrive in each city a day or more before his meetings and walk around looking for local taste indicators like the popular models or hues of products like iPhones and Beats headphones.“I’m not looking for the outliers,” he said, “I want to know how to fit into the local mainstream.”",business
"The real pain will come in the next few months, as Irma causes a psychological ripple effect through the state that may discourage families from planning trips, said Dennis Speigel, president of International Theme Park Services, a consulting firm in Cincinnati.“Orlando lives, breathes, thrives on tourists, and the theme parks are the drivers of that,” he said. “This is a really hard loss — hundreds of millions of dollars in aggregate for the industry down there.”Last year, 68 million tourists visited Orlando, and more than 70 million were expected this year, Mr. Speigel said. But much of the supporting infrastructure of hotels and restaurants has lost power, access to transit and regular deliveries of supplies.“These trips are planned six to eight months in advance, with the average family of four spending somewhere in the $7,000 to $8,000 range,” he said. “If you’ve lost a day, you’ve lost that day and you can’t get it back.”Roughly 100 sites shut down across the state in advance of the storm, including the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex and the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, according to the Florida Attractions Association.",business
"Right now in the United States there are some 800,000 law-abiding young people without proper immigration papers who nevertheless proudly call America home. Today President Trump sent them a clear message: They are not welcome here. With its decision to terminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which has protected these “Dreamers” since 2012, the administration claims that it is merely insisting that Congress take responsibility for the program. That is a dodge, and a cowardly one. This cruel new policy is also a direct contradiction of the promise that President Trump made to the Hispanic community only months ago.In April, President Trump assured these Dreamers that they could “rest easy.” These young people fully appreciated that they had been afforded a once-in-a-lifetime privilege: the chance to study and work in United States without the constant fear of deportation thanks to DACA, which gave them a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and eligibility for a work permit. Now these Americans, all of whom were brought here through no fault of their own, can’t rest easy. Instead they will lie awake at night, wondering whether it will be their last one in America.Many actions taken by this White House have profoundly rattled my confidence in its commitment to inclusivity and its respect for diversity. But today’s decision was worst of all. An American president who does not believe there’s a place for young people whose passion and values exemplify the best of our tradition is simply not a president that I can continue to support. That is why, as the president and chief executive of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, I have chosen to resign from the President’s National Diversity Coalition, effective immediately.Despite my vocal opposition to candidate Trump during the 2016 campaign, President-elect Trump and members of his transition team assured me that the voices of our members — the 4.2 million Hispanic-owned businesses in America — would be heard inside this White House, particularly on key issues like immigration, infrastructure and tax reform.

"My latest contribution, an account of an auto parts factory in Michigan, strays a bit from the mission. It probably won’t satisfy many people still looking to understand Trump Country.I pursued it because I was interested in why nonmetropolitan regions — counties that the president won comfortably — had ceased to be leading incubators of jobs as they had been just a generation ago. But the answers to that question (educational disparities and the opioid crisis, among others) quickly became less interesting to me than the individuality and daily gains and setbacks of the factory’s owner, Anita-Maria Quillen.Ms. Quillen, 35, is one of those people we perhaps don’t know as well as we ought to.

On her computer monitor she has posted a sticky note to remind her to show empathy: “It’s about feelings.”The mother of two small boys, Ms. Quillen — whose husband works for her overseeing the factory floor — voted for Mr. Trump (and admires his daughter Ivanka). But her daily personal and business obsessions have nothing to do with national politics. When a consultant visited her plant in May and asked what she hoped for in the future, she told him, “The goal for the company as a whole is to provide a better life for the employees that choose to be part of our family here.”During my repeated visits in May and June, Ms. Quillen allowed me open access to her meetings and phone calls, her staff of 78 and the production floor.",business
"Francis urged Buchanan to run an unorthodox campaign (of the sort Trump ended up running), and was ignored. “If Buchanan loses the nomination, it will be because his time has not yet come,” Francis wrote. The moment would end up coming in 2016, 11 years after Francis’ death.Francis’ thought was infected by the same cancer that may destroy Trumpism. Francis was a racist. His friends and allies counseled him not to express his racist views openly, but people like that always go there, sooner or later.The Civil War was an open wound for many in his circle, and in 1994 Francis told a conference, “The civilization that we as whites created in Europe and America could not have developed apart from the genetic endowments of the creating people, nor is there any reason to believe that the civilization can be successfully transmitted to a different people.”He was fired by The Washington Times and cast out of the conservative movement by William F. Buckley and others.When you look at today’s world through the prism of Francis’ work, a few things seem clear: Trump is not a one-time phenomenon; the populist tide has been rising for years. His base sticks with him through scandal because it’s not just about him; it’s a movement defined against the so-called ruling class. Congressional Republicans get all tangled on health care and other issues because they don’t understand their voters. Finally, Trump may not be the culmination, but merely a way station toward an even purer populism.Trump is nominally pro-business. The next populism will probably take his ethnic nationalism and add an anti-corporate, anti-tech layer. Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple stand for everything Francis hated — economically, culturally, demographically and nationalistically.As the tech behemoths intrude more deeply into daily life and our very minds, they will become a defining issue in American politics. It wouldn’t surprise me if a new demagogue emerged, one that is even more pure Francis.",business
"The inaction helped Toshiba executives save face, at least for a while.But then came an accounting scandal in 2015, in which Toshiba admitted overstating its earnings by $1.2 billion over seven years. Top company leaders resigned, and investigators hired by the company blamed “a corporate culture where it is impossible to go against one’s bosses’ wishes.”Toshiba had been covering up cost overruns at its American nuclear subsidiary, Westinghouse Electric, which it bought amid an ill-timed expansion in 2006. Those losses later ballooned further: Westinghouse sought bankruptcy protection in March, after costing Toshiba $6 billion in write-offs. Toshiba said it would stop building new nuclear power plants and focus instead on maintaining older ones.Now, with the sale of a majority of the microchip unit, Toshiba is shrinking further.The company had been negotiating the sale for months, with a shifting roster of potential investors. The final list of buyers, disclosed in a statement on Thursday, had some surprising omissions.Two financial institutions controlled by the Japanese government that Toshiba had previously identified as major potential investors will not contribute money initially, the company said. The institutions, the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan and the Development Bank of Japan, may invest at a later date.The investors were instead drawn entirely from the private sector.In addition to Apple, they include three other American businesses: Seagate Technology and Kingston Technology, two data storage companies, and a venture capital arm of Dell, the computer maker. The South Korean semiconductor maker SK Hynix, and Hoya, a Japanese manufacturer of optical equipment, were also named as investors.Toshiba itself will retain just over 40 percent of the unit, one of the world’s largest producers of the flash memory chips used to store data in smartphones and other digital devices.In negotiating the deal, Toshiba struggled to balance its need for cash and its desire to retain control of the microchip unit, which has been described as the crown jewel in its vast portfolio of businesses.",business
"Freddie Head, 70, is an accomplished trainer in France. He rode a record-tying four winners in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe while elevating his family to among the most prominent in horse racing.

"If cryptocurrencies were to replace cash as the preferred anonymous medium of exchange, they could significantly expand the underground economy because they are so much more convenient than cash. There is no need to visit an A.T.M., and you can securely pay people regardless of their location. No wonder Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, expressed concerns recently that Bitcoin could become “the next Swiss bank account.”The I.R.S. understands this, which is why it has been pushing to break the anonymity of cryptocurrencies. In November, it persuaded a federal judge to order Coinbase, a popular Bitcoin exchange, to reveal the identity of the customers for more than 14,000 accounts (representing nearly nine million transactions).Blockchain technologies can also make it difficult for the I.R.S. to tax cryptocurrency trading profits. Here is a simple tax dodge that would be hard for the I.R.S. to prove: Suppose A, B and C are electronic addresses you own. You let the I.R.S. know you own A, but not B and C. You buy one Bitcoin at $15,000 and park it at A, expecting the price to go up. Just a few hours later, when a Bitcoin is worth $15,500, you send that Bitcoin to B and then to C.A few months later, when your Bitcoin is now worth $25,000, you send it from C to A and tell the I.R.S., “I sold a Bitcoin to an anonymous counterparty at B back at $15,500 and just now bought a Bitcoin from another anonymous counterparty at C for $25,000.” As a result, you owe taxes on capital gains of just $500 rather than $10,000.The I.R.S. can observe all the transactions between A, B and C on the Bitcoin blockchain, but it cannot disprove that B and C are “arm’s length” counterparties (that is, independent and not colluding). Rules in the United States that require financial institutions to verify the identity of address holders do not solve the problem, because as far as the I.R.S. knows, B and C could have been set up by a foreign institution that does not comply with such rules.",business
"DAVOS, Switzerland — One could get the feeling that President Trump might not be set for a rousing welcome when he arrives in this Swiss Alps resort this week to address the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum.The forum, a pilgrimage for the wealthy and powerful, is an unabashed champion of globalization. It advocates ceaselessly for the notion that every problem — from climate change to joblessness to terrorism to cybersecurity — requires international cooperation and multilateral solutions.Mr. Trump’s derisive rejection of such ideas as the woolly-headed notions of the global elite is central to his identity. He used his inaugural address a year ago to declare the dawning of a new “America First” era. He has since pulled the United States out of a sprawling Pacific trade deal, while renouncing American participation in the Paris climate accord. He has spurned the modern sensitivities to race and gender.While many here are poised to recoil at Mr. Trump’s arrival — diplomats, heads of state and members of human rights organizations — much of the moneyed elite who pay the bills for many Davos festivities are willing to overlook what they portray as the American president’s rhetorical foibles in favor of focusing on the additional wealth he has delivered to their coffers.",business
"“If you have a chronic disease, you shouldn’t be burdened by the cost,” said York F. Zöllner, professor of health economics at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences, explaining the German approach. “It’s not your fault.” He and others note that conventional insurance is meant to cover unpredictable costs. But the costs of chronic illnesses are predictably high.Germany offers people with chronic disease better-than-standard coverage. Every German is required to have insurance — and guaranteed access to it — typically through more than 100 public nonprofit insurers. People can pick which “sickness fund” to join, and the system is financed through a “contribution” equal to roughly 15 percent of their income — nearly half coming from their employer and the rest from their paycheck. The total payment is capped at about 650 euros per month for adults, which includes coverage for dependent relatives.While co-payments exist — for prescriptions and hospital stays, for example — they are capped at 2 percent of gross earnings, and people with chronic disease pay half of that, according to Dr. Zöllner, with their out-of-pocket spending on health cost capped at 1 percent of income.Since expensive prescription drugs are a big component of many treatments, Germany’s state health insurers have been negotiating prices with drugmakers since 2011, and drug prices there are generally lower than in the United States. The patient contribution for any prescription is five to 10 euros.Kaitlyn West, an American with Type 1 diabetes who recently moved to Germany for graduate school, said that in the United States she had been paying on average $400 per month in out-of-pocket expenses — close to $5,000 each year. The amount fluctuated wildly depending on how her insurance policy at the moment covered her pumps and medicines.On German public insurance, the monthly contribution is about $105 and her yearly out-of-pocket spending is capped at about $140 for supplies and $45 for insulin. “There are no fees for doctors’ visits, no fees for my blood draws and no hassle getting things done,” she said. “This system allows me to live a normal, stress-free life.”The German health system is based on the principle of solidarity, not individuality, Dr. Zöllner said. But reframed to appeal to current American concerns, it might translate: “There but for the grace of God go I,” since at this point there are so many treatable chronic diseases. The congressional logic that led to the 1972 kidney-care exception could apply to any of those conditions.",business

"DAVOS, Switzerland — When I visit university campuses, I’m periodically asked if students who seek jobs in the business world are immoral, money-grubbing sellouts.I don’t think they are, for businesses can be a hugely important force for progress. Can be, but usually aren’t. Swirling in the air here in Davos at the World Economic Forum, along with snowflakes, is an important discussion of how companies must do far more to benefit the 99 percent, not just the 1 percent. Enriching shareholders is not enough.We interrupt this column for a paragraph of cynicism. Tycoons always claim to cherish ordinary people’s best interests even as they rip them off. American tobacco executives have killed more people than Stalin managed to, and pharma executives recklessly peddling opioids may have killed as many people as Colombian drug lords, yet these business leaders sometimes seem to get moist-eyed describing the work they do.But the business toolbox is too important to give up on. To me, the most interesting people in Davos aren’t the presidents or celebrities, but the social entrepreneurs — those using business tools to address social problems — and their work offers an inspiring window into what can be accomplished.",business
"2. The president made barely any mention of geopolitics, or major international issues like climate change. China was not noted at all. Nor was India, nor Iran nor even Europe.Mr. Trump did, however, soften some of his nationalist rhetoric. He said he would “always put America first, just as the leaders of other countries should put their countries first.”“But America first does not mean America alone,” he continued. “When the United States grows, so does the world.”3. Mr. Trump predicted the recently passed tax cuts — including a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent — would result in billions of dollars in new investments and jobs.The actual impact remains unclear. But the president claimed that several business leaders had made such promises to him in private meetings.4. The president can stick to the script when he wants to. He read his entire speech carefully from a Teleprompter and did not go off-message — a tendency that has gotten him into trouble in the past.Still, he could not resist referring to “fake news” outlets in a brief question-and-answer session after his speech.Advertisement Continue reading the main story“It wasn’t until I became a politician that I realized how nasty, how mean, how vicious, and how fake the press can be,” he said.5. There is at least one new way for companies to curry favor with Mr. Trump: giving their workers payouts related to the tax cut.The cascade of bonuses, the president said, had been “like a big, beautiful waterfall.”Of note: One company he specifically mentioned was the telecommunications giant AT&T, which is locked in a legal battle to get approval of its merger with Time Warner. —REBECCA BLUMENSTEINVideoPragmatist or populist? Trump walks a fine line.Speakers at the World Economic Forum usually celebrate globalization, praise diversity and decry climate change. So Friday’s speech by President Trump, who has at times voiced skepticism on all three stances, was warily awaited by the assembled business and government leaders.They need not have worried.Sounding more like the businessman he used to be than the outspoken populist he has become, Mr. Trump delivered a broad endorsement of recent Republican tax legislation. He said he favored free trade, provided that abusive trade practices by other countries were curbed. And he emphasized the importance of raising the prosperity of all Americans, particularly mentioning low unemployment among African-Americans.But almost completely missing from his remarks was the sometimes confrontational nationalism of his election campaign and many of his tweets.Mr. Trump instead portrayed the United States and other nations as having common interests.He said that the United States was “lifting up forgotten communities,” and was fulfilling the dreams of Americans for “a great job, a safe home and a better life for their children.”The president also took credit for rising share prices: “The stock market is smashing one record after another.”Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Apple had said it estimated it would have a $350 billion impact on the American economy over the next five years.How much of that goes beyond what Apple would have spent anyway?The technology company’s current pace of spending in the United States is $55 billion for 2018, so it was already on track to spend $275 billion over the next five years. After a $38 billion tax payment for repatriating money is subtracted, that leaves its new investment at roughly $37 billion over the next five years.How much of that, if any, would go toward manufacturing was unclear. Apple has said it plans to open a new domestic campus that, at least initially, will house technical support for customers. More than $10 billion of planned capital expenditures will go toward American data centers. More than 20,000 new jobs will be spread across facilities old and new. —TIFFANY HSUDid the president consider firing Mueller? ‘Fake news,’ he says.Upon arrival at the Congress Center in Davos, President Trump was greeted by a scrum of the forum’s participants snapping cellphone photos and a large group of reporters asking why he had ordered the firing last June of Robert S.

Goodlatte of Virginia. “These are people that really have shifted a lot,” he told CNBC. “They’ve really shifted a lot and I think they’re willing to shift more, and so am I.” —PETER BAKERVideoMending fences? Not with everyone.The president expressed regret for sharing anti-Muslim videos originally posted by an ultranationalist fringe group in Britain, but he made no apology on Friday for calling African nations “shithole countries,” or some variant of that phrase.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyMr. Trump said that when he retweeted the videos, which portrayed Muslims as violent attackers, he knew nothing about Britain First, the group that had originally posted them.“If you are telling me they’re horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologize, if you’d like me to do that,” Mr. Trump told Piers Morgan of the British broadcaster ITV, in an interview scheduled to air on Sunday.The rare expression of repentance — one of Mr. Trump’s rules is “never apologize” — came as the president sought to patch up a badly strained relationship with Britain.But Mr. Trump’s contrition and efforts at fence-mending went only so far: He ignored reporters’ questions on Friday about his derogatory remarks about African countries this month.During a meeting with lawmakers, the president had said he thought the United States should accept more immigrants from countries like Norway, rather than Haiti or “shithole countries” in Africa, according to multiple reports. Mr. Trump has disputed the reports and some have suggested that he actually said “shithouse countries.”After the remark was made public, Paul Kagame, president of Rwanda and chairman of the African Union, issued a statement demanding a retraction and “an apology to not only the Africans but to all people of African descent around the globe.”Mr. Trump and Mr. Kagame met on Friday, shortly before Mr. Trump’s scheduled address to the World Economic Forum.Mr. Kagame said that he had “good discussions” with Mr. Trump about the economy and trade, and he thanked Mr. Trump for his support. But the Rwandan leader made no mention of the furor over the comments. —PETER BAKER",business

"About four years ago, Maximilian Büsser, founder of the boutique watch brand MB&F, bought his wife a 1970s Rolex Air-King for $2,500 on the website Chrono24. When it arrived, he was dismayed (though perhaps not shocked) to learn that he’d been conned.“The crown was not original, the dial was not original, the case was not original and the glass was not even glass but a piece of Plexi glued to it,” Mr. Büsser recalled. “Buying a pre-owned or vintage timepiece is extremely risky business. Most brands have turned their backs on the market and left it in the hands of a lot of individuals who are not to be trusted. It’s time to reclaim it.”Come summer, the brand will do just that, when its website begins selling pre-owned MB&F timepieces offered mostly by customers. Mr. Büsser emphasized that the models will be limited editions no longer available at retail “because I don’t want my retailers to think I’m competing with them.”As innocuous as his announcement may sound, it’s sure to prompt some soul-searching among watch executives this week at the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie in Geneva.

First there were powdered “creamers,” with their troublesome corn syrup solids. Then came soy, which may come closest to the real thing in nutrients and consistency. Grocery stores now stock an army of nut milks — almond, cashew, hazelnut, macadamia, you name it — which can be too grainy, too thin or frankly too flavorful. Pea milk? Sounds like a kindergarten taunt. Coconut and rice milk are basically water. Hemp milk? For the birds … and the hippies.The plant-based beverage industry is a $9.8 billion market projected to grow to over $16 billion in 2018, according to Innova Market Insights, and one of its most promising entrants is oat milk. Baristas are bullish on its creamy-yet-neutral taste, its foamability and its ecological cred.Their brand of choice is Oatly, a 25-year-old food-and-beverage company founded in Malmo, Sweden, the onetime home of the author Karl Ove Knausgaard. Oatly’s image has been reworked over the last five years, with graphic packaging and sleek marketing materials, including a video of the company’s C.E.O. singing an ode to the oat amid a field of grains and avowals of its authenticity.“We know how it sounds,” Oatly’s website acknowledges. “Tall, blond, beautiful, hard to get, extremely liberal with no sense of attachment or responsibility whatsoever.

"The inquiry these fictitious people made was simple: They asked for local restaurant recommendations. We tracked whether hotel employees responded and also analyzed the content of the emails from those who did respond.Across the range of responses, racial discrimination was clear. Overall, hotel employees were significantly more likely to respond to inquiries from people who had typically white names than from those who had typically black and Asian names. But racial bias did not end there. Discrimination also happened in many subtle ways.Hotel employees provided 20 percent more restaurant recommendations to white than to black or Asian people. Employees’ politeness also varied by race. When responding to white people, employees were more likely to address them by name and to end their emails with a complimentary close (e.g., “Best,” “Sincerely”) than they were when responding to black or Asian people. And employees were more likely to go “above and beyond” in their service: They were three times as likely to provide extra information — even when the initial inquiry was just about restaurants — to white than to black or Asian people.The manager at Starbucks called the police with the claim that the two men were “refusing to make a purchase.” The manager did not believe that they were customers.Our research suggests that this belief — that a nonwhite person cannot or will not be a legitimate customer — can indeed worsen discrimination in service delivery. In a follow-up study, we emailed nearly 2,000 hotels and made a similar inquiry about local restaurants. But this time, in addition to varying the race of the inquirers, we varied whether they made clear their intention to stay at the hotel. Indeed, making customer status explicit helped reduce discrimination against minority people. These results are in line with the recent incident at Starbucks: We see that service workers do not apply the rule that every person is a potential customer deserving the same level of service.",business
"Violence, or its absence, has long been at the center of debates among privacy advocates. When the privacy scholar Daniel Solove, for example, published a taxonomy of privacy infringement in 2006, a fellow law professor, Ann Bartow, was unimpressed. Though she agreed with his overall argument, she felt that the paper “frames privacy harms in dry, analytical terms that fail to sufficiently identify and animate the compelling ways that privacy violations can negatively impact the lives of living, breathing human beings beyond simply provoking feelings of unease”; his taxonomy, she complained, lacked “enough dead bodies.”“Most privacy problems,” Solove argued dryly in response, “lack dead bodies.” They also lack most of the other egregious consequences that people tend to emphasize when they want to up privacy’s perceived stakes. Elsewhere, Solove has pointed out that such arguments are more often than not made with reference to the dire intrusions of George Orwell’s “1984,” a convenient shorthand for the crises of authoritarian omnipotence. The villain invoked is the rapacious watcher — the bilateral, panoptic “telescreen” in Winston’s home — backed by ruthless violence. “Under this paradigm,” Solove wrote, “privacy is invaded by uncovering one’s hidden world, by surveillance and by the disclosure of concealed information.” Durbin himself is a lawyer, as he reminded Zuckerberg, and implicit in his prosecution was the basic distinction of privacy law as conceived in the late 19th century: There is information that is private and information that is public, and the transgression of that boundary is a slippery slope to murder.What Durbin discovered is that Zuckerberg was delighted to argue on that terrain. Facebook has no trouble endorsing an argument for privacy in the terms of revelation — the revelation of location information that might be seen by a knife-wielding antagonist, at an extreme, or simply the drunken photos that might be seen by your boss. Our company, he said countless times over the course of his own interrogation, has menus upon menus of options to restrict the information other people might see and has limited third-party access since 2015. Besides, most users believe that they know what they are and aren’t broadcasting: If despised billionaires don’t post their hotel information, they won’t be killed, and if everybody else doesn’t post drunken photos, they won’t lose their jobs. All of this creates the impression that the adverse consequences of Facebook usage are only matters of disclosure, and that any breaches over the past few years are probably the user’s own fault.Advertisement Continue reading the main storySolove proposed we relinquish our “1984” fixation and find metaphorical support in Franz Kafka’s “The Trial”: “a more thoughtless process of bureaucratic indifference, arbitrary errors and dehumanization, a world where people feel powerless and vulnerable, without any meaningful form of participation in the collection and use of their information.” In part this is about the difference between state and corporate power, but it’s also about effects subtler and further-reaching than the simple surveillance of what we mutter in bed.PhotoWe ought to worry, on his view, much less about the Thought Police and much more about how our informational profiles harden into the invisible architecture of our everyday lives. It’s not that we might be observed or killed in our sleep, but rather that the availability of loans or jobs or romantic partners or upscale hotel rooms are already being silently and automatically withdrawn from “people like us” — people with our politics, people of our skin color, people with certain friends or predispositions, people without the wealth and power of Mark Zuckerberg. Or, in the case of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, it’s that our political affiliations are being arranged on the basis of our greatest vulnerabilities. Zuckerberg is more than happy to grant Durbin a victory that leaves all of this potential intact.The best recent definition of privacy doesn’t require hotel-room carnage to make a case for why we should still pay attention to our persistent feelings of unease. The philosopher Helen Nissenbaum defines privacy not as one right to be balanced with others but as the condition of what she calls “contextual integrity.” When we talk about privacy, she says, we’re not talking about the difference between the intimacy of the bedroom and the scrutiny of the park, but rather the specific norms and expectations that govern communication among various parties at different times and places. The old public-private distinction, she writes, postulates “only two contexts with distinct sets of informational norms for each — privacy constraints in the private, anything goes in the public. The framework of contextual integrity, by contrast, postulates a multiplicity of social contexts, each with a distinctive set of rules governing information flows.” There are things we discuss with lovers that we don’t discuss with bosses, and things we discuss with doctors that we might not discuss with lawyers, and so on.There are a variety of possible policy implications — beginning with the idea that a one-size-fits-all legal-consent model, where clicking “I agree” signs all your data away, should be regarded as nonsense. But the idea of contextual integrity is most immediately useful as a diagnostic aid in the absence of dead bodies, a way to render precise our otherwise vague sense of agitation. It does a lot, for example, to explain exactly what’s so unsettling about the Cambridge Analytica issue, and why the congressional hearings were so unsatisfying. Many of the questions from our elected officials seemed to turn on the epiphany that what seemed like a service to connect friends was actually a service to sell ads, but most Facebook users are neither that stupid nor that naïve; everybody knows at this point that if you’re not paying for something, you’re the product being sold. Yes, that omnipresent shoe ad might be creepy, but as autonomous subjects we feel more than capable of simply not buying the shoes. Our decision to purchase one shoe over another doesn’t seem to have broad social consequences.Until all of a sudden we weren’t talking about shoe ads anymore, and we weren’t talking about minor personal decisions that could easily be reversed. It turned out we had been prepared to accept some intermingling of the norms of personal communication with the norms of the commercial marketplace, but even the most cynical among us didn’t quite realize the implications of letting all that bleed into the political. There was at last clear evidence to support a notion of privacy as a social good rather than an individual right — and, finally, a way to talk about why privacy matters without recourse to sensationalism. The “dead bodies” of the privacy debate might finally be laid to rest.",business
"I vividly remember the first time I heard someone describe a world without cash. It was 2012, and I was at an event in London, listening to Ajay Banga, the chief executive of Mastercard, extol the virtues of digital currencies and the problems with paper money.Cash, he argued, enabled all sorts of bad behavior. Drug dealers, illicit arms traders, tax evaders and sex traffickers all rely on cash, he said. Make cash obsolete and those nefarious activities get much more difficult. Plus, cash is dirty, a vector for germs and disease.It was a compelling argument, but at the time, my wallet stuffed with colorful plasticy pounds, I thought he was crazy. Old habits die hard, and humans have been using cash, in one form or another, for roughly 7,000 years.Plus, forsaking cash can be more difficult for the bankless, many of whom have been through economic crises and are ineligible for credit cards and bank accounts. (Though it’s getting easier, thanks to the efforts of companies like PayPal.)Yet since that trip to London, Mr. Banga’s words have been rattling around my head, and sure enough, I’ve found myself relying less and less on cash.A big reason for my increasing reliance on digital payments is that if you sign up for the right card and don’t carry a balance, credit cards can be a great deal. Last year, I got the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, which caused a frenzy when it was released. Yes, it costs $450 a year, but it quickly delivered $1,500 worth of travel credits.Then last month, I signed up for the Amazon Prime Rewards card, which gives me 5 percent back on all purchases on Amazon and at Whole Foods, two major cost centers for our household. These aren’t exactly life-changing windfalls, but the benefits accrue over time, something cash can’t offer.",business
"Over the past week, horrified Indians have protested vigorously on social media and in some cities. The disgust and the fury at the complicity of politicians, and the federal government’s silence, grew into a thunderous chorus demanding that the prime minister speak up and fire the ministers backing the Hindu Ekta Manch.Belatedly reacting to popular outrage, Mr. Modi finally said: “Incidents being discussed since past two days cannot be part of a civilized society. As a country, as a society, we all are ashamed of it.” He promised justice. His vague statement delicately alluded to another case in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where a lawmaker from Mr. Modi’s party is accused of rape. Mr. Modi stayed away from his party’s involvement in both cases.Yet instead of uniting India in horror, the incident has deepened religious, political and ethical divides. It has also made clear that there is no automatic political cost to crime or falsehood if it furthers the hegemonic political narrative. The politicians involved were sacked only after a huge public outcry. Government ministers, officials, right-leaning media and right-wing supporters have been perfectly sanguine about using the dead child to polarize society with whataboutery, fake news and wild conspiracy theories.A spokeswoman for Mr. Modi’s party, Meenakshi Lekhi, attacked opposition protests, suggesting that they were selective and opportunistic. “You see their plan,” she said. “First shout ‘minority minority’, then ‘Dalit Dalit’ and now ‘women women’ and then try to somehow fix blame of state issues on the center.” An influential ex-editor tweeted that Muslim Rohingya refugees were to blame for the crime. A B.J.P. youth activist posted a comment, now deleted, on his Facebook page saying that the rape must have been fun. A pornography site reported a surge in searches for videos using the raped and murdered girl’s name.The sense of national crisis today is because Indians feel a rising urgency to either counter this ethical collapse or to capitalize on it in the run-up to the next election.Mr. Modi came to power in 2014, and four years into his term, religious and cultural bigotry stands mainstreamed in Indian society.Many who voted for Mr. Modi’s economic promises are disappointed by his failure to deliver, and impatient with his deliberate silences around sectarian and sexual violence and hate speech by his party colleagues and ministers. The systematic destruction of democratic institutions is hard to ignore.The B.J.P. and its Hindu nationalist affiliates are bent on refashioning India into a country that is increasingly hostile to secular, democratic, pluralist and minority Indians. The rape and murder of the little nomad girl has thus taken on a larger meaning, reflecting the struggle for the fundamental character of India.",business
"Whenever President Putin is touted as the world’s most powerful or influential politician, I feel puzzled. The rules that Mr. Putin follows are technical. He is no philosopher of government; he is a skilled practitioner. These rules are simply ad hoc mechanisms for holding onto power in a dangerous environment. And the Kremlin political managers are skillful plumbers who deal with old leaky piping and loathe the idea of replacing it.Do other nations really have anything to learn from them?I would argue that perceived similarities between President Trump’s thinking and Mr. Putin’s do not necessarily mean that Mr. Trump has been learning from Russia’s president. When your objective, like Mr. Trump’s, is surviving in power, you arrive, on your own, at pragmatic rules that work for you. The extent to which President Trump values survival is unique among Western leaders. Mr. Putin has been fighting for survival for years, and he has become a grandmaster of that dark art.But playing this game has consequences. Just as the Kremlin has ad hoc rules, most Russians have some, too. They “get” what it takes to prosper in their system: Pretend you are loyal, tell the interviewer you approve of the president, mark the right box and there you go. Freedom!This doesn’t sound heroic, but heroes are a rare breed. The Russian people and the Russian state cohabitate, each minding its own business.Disasters and tragedies are occasions when state and people meet. Sparks of conflict start to fly because both sides realize they’ve been fooling each other. The Kremlin and its viceroys have pretended to manage, and the people on the ground have pretended to be loyal. There’s a crisis of loyalty, if you will. It’s not that loyalty is lacking; it’s that there’s too much loyalty, and it’s all fake. And that brings a moment of truth, when everyone realizes that Russians would jump at any opportunity to turn their relationship with the state back on its feet.But all of that goes away quickly because it bumps up against precisely what the Kremlin is there for: to close down the pockets of normalcy. Any attempt at holding the president accountable is made so costly for the people, and the propaganda of the opposite view is so relentless, that Russians put up with all of this just to stay out of trouble and have a normal life.The principles recounted above are not the sort in which you choose to believe; they must be imposed. And by the time you recognize that a system like this is around you, it is probably too late to resist. You will have to learn the Putin creed or something similar.So, really, there is no rush to learn from him.",business
"In the early 1880s, legend has it that Daniel B. Wesson, a co-founder of Smith & Wesson, the gun manufacturer, heard about a child who injured himself by cocking the hammer and pulling the trigger of one of his firm’s revolvers. Wesson, known as D. B., was so distraught about the accident that he and his son, Joseph, developed a more child-safe revolver that they called the .38 Safety Hammerless.Wesson was also my great-great-great-grandfather. Though it has been half a century since my family was involved with Smith & Wesson, I feel a twinge of responsibility every time a mass shooting occurs. I realize this is not entirely rational: I play no part in making or selling firearms and have never lost anyone close to me from gun violence. But it still haunts me.After 17 people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., I learned the shooter used a Smith & Wesson M&P 15, a version of an AR-15 military-style rifle. So I had to ask myself: What would D. B. Wesson have wanted his company to do? Would he have accepted the repeated refrain, “Guns don’t kill people, people kill people”?Obviously I cannot know what D. B. Wesson would want. But I would like to believe that he would have recoiled in horror and disbelief at the weapons created by the brand still bearing his name. And that he would have wanted all of us to ask more of his company today.",business
"In 2006, the sale of condos in the first international hotel venture under the Trump brand, the former Trump Ocean Club International Hotel and Tower in Panama, fell, in large part, to a Brazilian named Alexandre Ventura Nogueira. He worked with a Colombian who was later convicted of money laundering. Mr. Nogueira told NBC News last year that he sold about half of his Trump condos to Russians, including some connected to the Russian mafia, and that some of his clients had “questionable backgrounds.”Three years later, as Reuters has reported, Panamanian authorities arrested Mr. Nogueira on charges of fraud and forgery unrelated to the Trump project. After getting out on bail, he fled to Brazil, where he faces a separate money-laundering investigation. In 2014, he fled Brazil, too.The Trumps typically claim to be passive partners in projects like Trump Ocean Club and that they had minimal dealings with the likes of Mr. Nogueira. (The chief legal officer for the Trump Organization, Alan Garten, has said that no one in the Trump family remembers meeting or speaking to Mr. Nogueira. But there are photos of Mr. Trump and his daughter Ivanka with Mr. Nogueira.) Yet Mr. Trump’s limited public disclosures reveal his company has earned millions from licensing fees, a percentage of property sales and management fees in foreign projects. And the Trump family was sometimes personally involved in everything from a project’s design to its décor.That appears to have been the case with the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, a high-end residence and hotel that has yet to open. In 2012, the Trumps signed a licensing agreement with the local developer, Anar Mammadov — the son of the country’s billionaire transportation minister, Ziya Mammadov, who an American diplomat once described in cables published by WikiLeaks as “notoriously corrupt even for Azerbaijan.”The Trump Organization has said that it conducted an extensive due-diligence review of Anar Mammadov and that questions about the source of his wealth surfaced after they signed the deal. Presumably, Mr. Mueller will want to see evidence of that.In Vancouver, the Trump Organization partnered with the son of Tony Tiah Thee Kian, a Malaysian oligarch who was convicted of providing a false report to the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. That project, which was guided by Ivanka Trump and is one of the few Trump-branded properties to open since Mr. Trump took office, is now the subject of an F.B.I. counterintelligence inquiry, according to CNN. Mr. Garten, the Trump chief legal officer, told CNN: “The company’s role was and is limited to licensing its brand and managing the hotel. Accordingly, the company would have had no involvement in the financing of the project or the sale of units.”It remains unclear whether Mr. Mueller will investigate these deals, or already is. But a comprehensive investigation could raise questions about the Trump Organization’s compliance with anti-money-laundering laws and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which — according to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice — makes it a crime for a United States company to act with willful blindness toward the corrupt activities of a foreign business partner.",business
"My colleagues on the news side of The Times had a good exposé yesterday on another example of oligopoly: the music business. Live Nation appears to be using its power to hurt both consumers and other industry players. And it’s able to do so partly because the Obama administration allowed the company to merge with TicketMaster in 2010.Washington’s lenient approach to corporate power in recent decades — from both parties — has aggravated inequality, and it’s time for that approach to change. Fortunately, there are some early, if still tentative, signs that this may be changing. The Democrats have put antitrust policy at the center of their economic agenda. And the Trump administration actually has a more nuanced stance on antitrust than it does in many other areas, even if that stance is sometimes for the wrong reasons.If you want to learn more about the issue, you can start with some of the pieces that Washington Monthly — a pioneer on this subject — has published. The Obama administration’s Council of Economic Advisers and the Roosevelt Institute have also done good work.Podcast recommendation. Robert Mueller’s investigation has reportedly widened to include efforts to influence American policy on behalf of the Saudi and Emirati governments.

"BlackRock may have found a simple solution to its gun dilemma. The fund manager, led by Laurence D. Fink, will offer new products allowing individuals and institutions to invest in market indexes without putting money into manufacturers and retailers of firearms. Coupled with a plan to engage public gunmakers and sellers directly, the decision moves Mr. Fink closer to fulfilling a promise that BlackRock’s business benefit society alongside the bottom line.Because it has over $6 trillion of client money to invest, much of it in products that follow stock and bond market indexes, BlackRock is among the top owners of nearly every public company. That includes American Outdoor Brands, maker of the AR-15-style rifle used to murder 17 high school students and their teachers in Parkland, Fla., in February. And that put Mr. Fink, who has urged companies to serve a social purpose, in an uncomfortable position at a time of mass demonstrations and consumer boycotts over gun violence.On Thursday, his firm unveiled a range of index products that will enable investors to withhold their support for gunmakers and sellers. They include an exchange-traded fund that will track the performance of the MSCI USA Small Cap Extended ESG Focus Index, composed of small stocks with favorable environmental, social and governance standards, while specifically excluding producers and large retailers of civilian firearms. It will also offer a similar credit-focused E.T.F. that eschews the debt of gunmakers and distributors.Perhaps more significant, BlackRock will offer an option to take the guns out of institutional strategies tracking major market indexes, including the Standard & Poor’s 500, the Russell 2000 and three others. The reason: Amid the debate over gun safety that the Parkland tragedy has unleashed, many pension funds and company 401(k) plans have been looking to disarm, largely in response to the demand of their own members.",business
"Since President Obama moved to normalize relations with Cuba in December, you might think the nation has put out a big “Open for Business” sign. Trade delegations seem to land in Havana every day. But traveling there for business is not as easy as it might appear, despite significant changes.“The president has made travel to Cuba for commercial purposes easier,” said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a business organization in New York that focuses on Cuba without taking political positions. “But he hasn’t said, ‘Do what you want, and there will be no monitoring.’ What he has done is encourage you to do more in Cuba but to remember that there remain regulations that need to be followed.”Mr. Kavulich said there are two ways to travel to Cuba for Americans interested in exploring business possibilities on their own (that is, outside of an official delegation, like the one led by Gov.

"ESPN will make its annual upfront presentation to advertisers Tuesday morning in a Broadway theater, four days after scripting the latest act in its relationship with Bill Simmons, if not its final one. Last Friday, John Skipper, ESPN’s president, effectively fired Simmons, one of the company’s best known employees and the founding editor of its Grantland website, by announcing that he would not renew his contract.The message was clear: Regardless of your influence or the number of people who listen to your podcasts, no one is bigger than the brand.Since Skipper’s Friday morning putsch, Simmons has remained publicly silent. His last message on Twitter, posted Friday morning, referred to the previous night’s edition of “The Grantland Basketball Hour.” He has gained about 200,000 followers since then, most of them waiting for his next post, preferably one that punches his bosses in the snout.But do not expect Simmons to say anything, at least about his departure, until he and ESPN are legally done with each other.

"Leisure travelers have become used to controlling every step of a trip, from booking a flight or a car to making dinner reservations. Business travelers, less so; there has always been some corporate bean counter looking over their shoulders.But that is changing as business travel picks up and the overseers of company budgets permit the digital empowerment of traveling employees and tentatively embrace the sharing economy.Travel managers are calling this the age of traveler centricity, and apps from Uber, the ride-hailing service, and similar innovations are increasingly part of it. In the next few years, if company policies can keep up, the new era of personalized travel could lead to a host of new so-called intelligent services, delivered through apps and smartphones, that will automatically assist business travelers based on their profiles and preferences, potentially making what is typically a grind through traffic, airports and tight itineraries less stressful and more productive.“There is a shift away from the command-and-control perspectives of the past,” said Greeley Koch, executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives. “The focus now is more on the traveler and the productivity of each trip, so that travelers can have the greatest return on investment on each trip.”",business
"Evan Malter, ZipCap’s founder and chief executive, considers the relationship aspect of ZipCap’s system just as important as the “cheap money” part. “We want people to see the impact they have on their local economy,” he said. “When a customer feels as though they have contributed to the success of a business, they have a greater bond to that business and are more compelled to visit.”ZipCap’s unusual lending model, Mr. Malter said, emerged from his desire to fix flaws in other small-business financing options, particularly interest rates so high that he considers them predatory. It is also the result of trial-and-error experimentation.Mr. Malter initially set out to create a very different venture: an equity crowdfunding site that would help business owners raise capital from their customers. But the more he learned about how neighborhood retailers operate, the less he liked that idea. Razor-thin margins leave little room for investor profit, he realized, and merchants’ accounting systems are often messy and ad hoc. “How a pizza shop owner is running the business is not something anyone can do due diligence on, much less the crowd,” he said.So he started over, focusing on the issues that often prevent small-business owners from obtaining affordable loans: lack of collateral and low (or nonexistent) profitability. “By using customer loyalty as collateral and an asset, we’re creating an accounts receivable stream for the kinds of businesses that otherwise have none,” Mr. Malter said.The question on which the entire model hinges, though, is how reliable customers’ spending pledges turn out to be. ZipCap has 10 Michigan businesses in various stages of a pilot program and is tracking their Inner Circle follow-through rates. At Beezy’s, five months in, 117 members — 90 percent of the group — are on pace to fulfill their pledges. Nine have already done so and renewed for another $475 commitment. One member dropped out, and 12 are falling short of their target.To succeed, ZipCap will need to sell both merchants and investors on its loyalty capital concept and prove that it is an effective way to underwrite loans. Robert Foster, a veteran of the impact investing industry and a board member of the Social Venture Network, says the start-up is one he is keeping a close eye on.“This is a challenging pool of applicants to lend to,” Mr. Foster said. “You’re essentially an unsecured creditor. ZipCap believes that social pressure is enough to keep people doing the right thing, to keep customers fulfilling their pledges and borrowers paying back their loans. The $1 million question for me is: Is that glue really strong enough?”",business
"But if there is no new treaty, Mr. Cameron will only be able to get diluted versions of what he has promised. Maybe he can get a commitment from other European Union leaders to alter the phrase on “ever closer union” when and if there is a treaty change. Perhaps he can persuade the European Commission to abandon any legislation that half of the national parliaments propose.The knottiest issue may be overhauling social benefits, because immigration is a hot topic with the electorate. Among other things, Mr. Cameron wants to stop European Union migrants gaining access to so-called in-work benefits — money those in low-paid jobs get to replenish their earnings — until they have lived in the country for four years. While many other leaders are sympathetic, that particular plan may fall foul of treaty commitments not to discriminate against European Union citizens from other countries.The euroskeptics in Mr. Cameron’s party will presumably try to box him in on all these issues. It will important that he maintains wiggle room.A further question will concern when the referendum occurs. Mr. Cameron has promised that it will be by the end of 2017 but said he would like it to be earlier if possible.If there was a prospect of a new treaty, there would be a good reason for waiting until 2017. But, in the absence of that, Mr. Cameron should go for an earlier vote.This is partly because of the European Union economic cycle. The eurozone will grow this year as a result of the European Central Bank’s huge new money printing operation. But the effects of this will wear off and, with oil prices rising again, there’s no certainty that the eurozone will perform well from mid-2016 onward. Mr. Cameron will find it harder to persuade the British people to stay in the European Union if it looks like Britain is shackled to a corpse.The European Union political cycle is another reason to prefer an earlier referendum. In 2017, there is a general election in Germany and a presidential election in France.",business
"PARIS — The eurozone economy continues to expand at a modest pace, a survey of businesses showed on Thursday, though an apparent slowdown in Germany raised concerns about the strength of the recovery.A survey of eurozone purchasing managers by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm, showed the economy of the bloc of 19 European Union countries that use the euro still growing at a comfortable, if not exactly blistering, rate.Markit’s composite output index for the eurozone came in at 53.4 in May, down from 53.9 in April. A number above 50 signals that the economy is continuing to expand, while a figure below that suggests contraction.Intriguingly, the report also suggested that hiring was picking up, which would be a welcome development in a region weighed down by unemployment that has hovered at or above 11 percent for more than three years.

Chinese companies are buying trophy properties in New York. They are building manufacturing operations in the Midwest. And they are snapping up Internet companies in California.In all, Chinese companies have invested $46 billion in the United States since 2000, with most coming in the last five years, according to a study prepared by the Rhodium Group, a New York research firm, to be released on WednesdayAt the same time, geopolitical tensions with China have been rising. Washington is worried about China’s construction of artificial islands and at least one military-grade airstrip on disputed shoals, as well as the country’s deployment of multiple, independently targeted hydrogen bomb warheads. The Obama administration has also raised concerns about the new Chinese-led development bank.",business
"Next, he needed a partner and chef. So, back in New York, he approached a friend, Thomas Kelly, who had hosted weekly dinner parties and served elaborate meals at Thanksgiving. “I always had this entrepreneurial itch like David,” Mr. Kelly said.Mr. Kelly, born in Minneapolis in 1978, developed a passion for cooking when he was a child. He would toil in the kitchen alongside his mother and grandmother, and help his father fire up the barbecue. Before graduating from Colorado State with a bachelor’s in humanities in 2000, he loved experimenting in the kitchen and cooking for roommates. Though he didn’t go to culinary school, after moving to New York in 2001, Mr. Kelly worked at a marketing job by day and trained as an unpaid intern at the restaurants Craft and Hearth by night, where he honed his kitchen skills. (He also got an M.B.A. from the New York University Stern School of Business in 2013.)In 2010, with $80,000 in their pockets, Mr. Schillace and Mr. Kelly bought a food truck off eBay, drew up a Mexican-barbecue menu and were on their way. Mr. Schillace said there was only one other branded food truck in Manhattan at the time. “It was like the Wild West,” he said, adding that they could park wherever they wanted. But by 2011, competition had soared with about 75 branded trucks crowding into the market, which led to city crackdowns. Retail operators often complained that their profits were threatened by the presence of food trucks.Mr. Schillace would arrive early and use his Jeep Cherokee to hold a spot on the street for the truck. One day, about 15 angry street vendors, unhappy that Mexicue was taking away their business, surrounded the jeep and began pounding on the windows, demanding that Mr. Schillace leave the area. Mr. Schillace, though scared, locked the doors and waited for the truck to arrive.Sometimes when a coveted spot was occupied by a repair truck, Mr. Schillace would call the phone number listed on the truck. Posing as a city employee, he would demand that the company move the truck immediately or it would be ticketed. “I’d see these repair guys running out of offices to move their trucks, and I’d just drive into the space when they left,” he said, laughing.",business
"Within The Huffington Post, and away from the glass table, some staff members have fretted that What’s Working could result in a steady drip of pallid, upbeat stories (e.g., ‘‘How Hugh Jackman’s Coffee Brand Is Changing Lives’’). But it’s hard to argue with Huffington’s intuitions when it comes to generating traffic. Her site has more than 200 million unique visitors each month, according to comScore, and it is one of the country’s top online destinations for news.Nevertheless, in May, Huffington’s tenure as editor in chief was briefly in question. The site’s corporate parent, AOL, was sold to Verizon for $4.4 billion, and Huffington was forced to spend a few weeks negotiating the terms of the site’s future with her new overlords. During that process, AOL revealed that two suitors, earlier in the year, tried to buy The Huffington Post for $1 billion, or roughly four times what Jeff Bezos paid for The Washington Post two years ago. Plainly, to certain investors, digital media companies are valuable because they deliver enormous audiences. Any difficulty turning a profit — The Huffington Post broke even last year on $146 million in revenue, according to someone familiar with the site’s finances — is considered a temporary problem that will eventually be fixed by the sheer size of the readership.This singular focus on audience development expresses itself in different ways at different publications. At The Huffington Post, it takes the shape of an editorial mandate that, much like the universe itself, is unfathomably broad and constantly expanding. At least in theory, nothing gets past its editors and writers. They cover, in most cases through aggregation, everything from Federal Reserve policy to celebrity antics, from Islamic State atrocities to parenting tips, supplemented with a steady stream of uncategorizable click bait (‘‘Can Cannibalism Fight Brain Disease? Only Sort Of’’).To work at The Huffington Post is to run a race without a finish line, at a clip that is forever quickening. The pace is stressful for many employees, who describe a newsroom with plenty of turnover. One former staff member I spoke with, who developed an ulcer while working there, called The Huffington Post ‘‘a jury-rigged, discombobulated chaos machine.’’Huffington may be the Internet’s most improbable media pioneer. This is her first job as an editor or publisher, and few would describe her as a techie. But as one of the first major media properties born in the full light of the digital age, The Huffington Post has always been a skunk works for the sorts of experiments that have come to define the news business in the Internet era.In its early days, when most visits came through Google searches, the site mastered search-engine optimization (S.E.O.), the art of writing stories based on topics trending on Google and larding headlines with keywords. The site’s annual ‘‘What Time Is the Super Bowl?’’ post has become such a famous example of S.E.O.-driven non-news that other media outlets have written half-disgusted, half-admiring posts dissecting its history.When most sites were merely guessing about what would resonate with readers, The Huffington Post brought a radical data-driven methodology to its home page, automatically moving popular stories to more prominent spaces and A-B testing its headlines. The site’s editorial director, Danny Shea, demonstrated to me how this works a few months ago, opening an online dashboard and pulling up an article about General Motors. One headline was ‘‘How GM Silenced a Whistleblower.’’ Another read ‘‘How GM Bullied a Whistleblower.’’ The site had automatically shown different headlines to different readers and found that ‘‘Silence’’ was outperforming ‘‘Bully.’’ So ‘‘Silence’’ it would be. It’s this sort of obsessive data analysis that has helped web-headline writing become so viscerally effective.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyAbove all, from its founding in an era dominated by ‘‘web magazines’’ like Slate, The Huffington Post has demonstrated the value of quantity. Early in its history, the site increased its breadth on the cheap by hiring young writers to quickly summarize stories that had been reported by other publications, marking the birth of industrial aggregation.PhotoToday, The Huffington Post employs an armada of young editors, writers and video producers: 850 in all, many toiling at an exhausting pace. It publishes 13 editions across the globe, including sites in India, Germany and Brazil. Its properties collectively push out about 1,900 posts per day. In 2013, Digiday estimated that BuzzFeed, by contrast, was putting out 373 posts per day, The Times 350 per day and Slate 60 per day. (At the time, The Huffington Post was publishing 1,200 posts per day.) Four more editions are in the works — The Huffington Post China among them — and a franchising model will soon take the brand to small and midsize markets, according to an internal memo Huffington sent in late May.Throughout its history, the site’s scale has also depended on free labor. One of Huffington’s most important insights early on was that if you provide bloggers with a big enough stage, you don’t have to pay them. This audience-for-content trade has been imitated successfully by outlets like Thought Catalog and Bleacher Report, a sports-news website that Turner Broadcasting bought in 2012 for somewhere between $150 million and $200 million.As this more-is-better ethos has come to define the industry, shifts in online advertising have begun to favor publications that already attract large audiences. Display advertising — wherein advertisers pay each time an ad is shown to a reader — still dominates the market. But native advertising, designed to match the look and feel of the editorial content it runs alongside, has been on the rise for years. BuzzFeed, the media company started in 2006 by Jonah Peretti, a co-founder of The Huffington Post, was built to rely entirely on native advertising. The Huffington Post offers to make its advertisers custom quizzes, listicles, slide shows, videos, infographics, feature articles and blog posts. Prices start at $130,000 for three pieces of content. This is where size matters; top-tier sites can fetch premium rates because advertisers know their messages could be seen by millions. There have been concerns that readers might be deceived by native ads if they are not properly identified — The Huffington Post always clearly labels its sponsored content — but the ethical debate in the media world is over. Socintel360, a research firm, predicts that spending on native advertising in the United States will more than double in the next four years to $18.4 billion.Kenneth Lerer, another Huffington Post co-founder, believes that news start-ups today are like cable-television networks in the early ’80s: small, pioneering companies that will be handsomely rewarded for figuring out how to monetize your attention through a new medium. If this is so, the size of The Huffington Post’s audience could one day justify that $1 billion valuation. But at least in cable, the ratings-driven mania of sweeps week comes only four times a year.Even as she oversees an international news operation, Huffington spends most of her days and nights in a globe-spanning run of lectures, parties, talk shows, conferences and meetings, a never-ending tour that she chronicles in a dizzying Instagram feed. Her stamina is a source of awe to members of what she calls her A-Team — the A is for Arianna — a group of 9 or so Huffington Post staff members who, in addition to their editorial duties, help keep her in perpetual motion. Within the organization, A-Team jobs are known to be all-consuming — but also, for those who last, a ticket to promotion later on. While some stick around for years, many A-Teamers endure only about 12 months before calling it quits or asking to be transferred.The first time I saw Huffington’s unremitting style up close was in New Haven last year, at the start of a tour to promote her self-help book, ‘‘Thrive.’’ In all of our interviews, she was warm and entertaining. She has a politician’s gift for seeming sincerely interested, having learned that nothing is so disarming as asking personal questions and then listening. She also has a comic’s timing. At a Barnes & Noble onstage chat in Manhattan, shortly before the trip to New Haven, the moderator, Katie Couric, asked her who was to blame for the merciless pace of life in corporate America. Huffington paused for a moment. Then she turned to the audience.‘‘Men,’’ she deadpanned.In her talk, she described her own transformation from fast-lane addict to evangelist for reflection, sleep and ‘‘digital detoxing’’ — basically, turning off your smartphone whenever possible. This is a catechism she has branded the ‘‘third metric’’ of success, with money and power being the first two. Her conversion narrative begins on the morning of April 6, 2007, when she collapsed from exhaustion. She fell to the floor in her home office, hitting her face on her desk and breaking her cheekbone. Medical tests found nothing that could explain the episode. Huffington realized that her lifestyle, which at the time was filled with 18-hour workdays, seven days a week, was wrecking her health.Advertisement Continue reading the main story‘‘By any sane definition of success,’’ she told the crowd that day in New Haven, ‘‘if you are lying in your office in a pool of blood, you are not a success.’’The speech, which I caught a few times, is always a hit. Huffington presents herself as a redemption story, someone who overdosed on her mobile phone and survived to warn others. She looks the part, too: a Dolce & Gabbana-ed woman of a certain age, perfectly at ease, regularly brushing back a forelock of honey-blond hair with her fingers. After the speech in New Haven, people lined up to have their copies of ‘‘Thrive’’ signed. One by one, they offered Huffington variations of, ‘‘You are an inspiration.’’ Some shared their own success stories.One woman told her: ‘‘In the horse world, I do holistic care, and I’m embarking on a barn that’s cutting-edge. It’s all about positive reinforcement.’’‘‘We’d love you to write about it!’’ Huffington exclaimed.Five years ago, in 2010, the site was successful, attracting nearly 25 million unique visitors a month, but it lacked the money Huffington felt it needed to expand. So it seemed fortunate when, later that year, she met Tim Armstrong, chief executive of AOL, at a media conference in New York.‘‘He asked to meet with me privately, and he said: ‘What do you want to do with The Huffington Post?’ ’’ Huffington recalled. ‘‘And I said, ‘I want to be a global company, I want us to be everywhere in the world.’ ’’Armstrong offered $315 million, and on Feb. 7, 2011, AOL announced the acquisition. Huffington was made the head of the Huffington Post Media Group, an entity that would control AOL’s empire of content — an odd mixture of offerings including Moviefone, TechCrunch, Engadget, MapQuest, Autoblog, AOL Music and the collection of hundreds of hyperlocal websites called Patch. In a stroke, Huffington found herself overseeing a diverse portfolio with 117 million unique visitors per month in the United States and 270 million around the world. She also managed several thousand editors, writers, bloggers and business staff members.Initially, Armstrong and Huffington seemed like a natural match. Each is a fan of big ideas that can be executed quickly; each prizes boldness and energy. At one AOL meeting with brand managers, Armstrong ribbed his underlings by recounting how Huffington called him on a Sunday to tell him what was wrong with AOL’s home page. Why had no one else done that?Integrating a group of such varied websites and personnel would have posed a challenge to any manager. For one who admits to having little interest in organization and planning, it was impossible. Huffington preferred to improvise, and she did so aggressively — ‘‘like a hockey player,’’ as one former AOL executive put it, with some admiration.Advertisement Continue reading the main storyA clash of cultures, however, was soon evident. Many of AOL’s sites did little more than promote their sponsors; AOL Real Estate, for instance, was mainly a home for Bank of America ads, next to stories about the joys of mortgage refinancing. In an attempt to restore some semblance of editorial integrity, Huffington fired the freelancers who worked for the site and replaced them with young staff members. Many were recent graduates of Yale — her feeder of choice — whose chief qualification, aside from the obvious, was a willingness to work for a pittance. But the hiring spree was rushed and filled the sites with fledglings. Page views plunged, irking corporate sponsors.Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

At some point, Huffington stopped going to meetings of AOL executives, and in April 2012, an organizational reshuffling quietly moved every AOL site except The Huffington Post out of Huffington’s portfolio. Her tenure as AOL content czar was over.By then, Huffington was having a serious case of seller’s remorse. During a tech conference, she was overheard at a bar in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif., talking to the venture capitalist Scott Stanford, then a Goldman Sachs banker. Speaking in a voice loud enough for many to hear, she posed questions like, ‘‘Who would buy The Huffington Post?’’ and ‘‘How much would it fetch?’’ Around that time, Huffington Post employees recall, she went on trips with very rich people and returned with news that the site was about to be purchased again, this time for $1 billion.But The Huffington Post was no longer Huffington’s to sell, and AOL seemed uninterested in parting with it. By October 2012, discontent with Huffington was widespread enough that top executives at AOL were quietly strategizing about ways to ease her into a kind of ceremonial role — one in which she would only promote the site rather than running its day-to-day operations. (A source said the effort was given a one-word shorthand: ‘‘Popemobile.’’ Like the Pope in his bulletproof bubble, Huffington would glide through the world and wave.) The idea never caught on, mostly because it was clear Huffington would never agree to it, and by May of this year, when Verizon announced its acquisition of AOL, it had long been abandoned.Verizon went after AOL principally for its ad-buying technologies, but in mid-June, Verizon’s C.E.O. and chairman, Lowell McAdam, said he was committed to keeping The Huffington Post, as incidental as its acquisition may have been. Huffington, whose contract with AOL expired earlier in the year, wanted guarantees that Verizon would finance the site’s growth and keep its hands off articles with which it may have a difference of opinion — those on net neutrality, for instance.Soon after the Verizon-AOL deal was announced, Huffington began to negotiate her future and the future of The Huffington Post. According to two sources, Armstrong suggested closing the acquisition first and prodding Verizon to make promises about The Huffington Post later. Huffington refused, and she held out until mid-June, when Verizon pledged more than $100 million a year for ongoing operations and vowed to give the site editorial autonomy. (Others with knowledge of the talks say that no financial commitments have been made yet.) The money will allow The Huffington Post to broaden its video offerings, supporting a 24-hour online network and what Huffington called, in an internal memo, a ‘‘rapid-response satire unit.’’ Assurances in hand, Huffington signed a new four-year contract that will keep her in situ as editor in chief.None of this necessarily means that The Huffington Post will remain in Verizon’s permanent portfolio. In fact, if Verizon’s real goal is to offload the site, it has done exactly what it should to burnish the asset for eventual sale. Were suitors to come courting again, they would surely offer less for a Huffington-less Huffington Post.That is not to say that Huffington is inexpensive to keep around. She flies all around the planet, occasionally with members of the A-Team in tow. A-Team duties include tending to Huffington’s Twitter account, her Instagram feed and her Facebook posts; running her errands; organizing her day; planning her travel; and prepping her speeches, which, if they aren’t pro bono, cost at least $100,000. One former A-Teamer recalled loading The Huffington Post on Huffington’s computer when she showed up at the office.‘‘Arianna doesn’t surf the web,’’ the former A-Teamer explained. ‘‘She reads stories that people send on her iPhone, and she sends and receives emails on her BlackBerry. But I’ve never seen her on a computer, surfing the web.’’ Huffington said that this is not true, and stated that she ditched her BlackBerry nearly two years ago. But more than a dozen former and current Huffington Post staff members said they had never seen her so much as open a web browser.Advertisement Continue reading the main storySome former employees file this in the category, Things at Odds With Arianna’s Public Image. Also in this category is the vibe at The Huffington Post’s downtown Manhattan office. Despite its nap rooms, meditation rooms and breathing classes, which were introduced as Huffington entered her ‘‘Thrive’’ phase, it is described as a surpassingly difficult place to work.Much of this difficulty is inherent to life at an Internet news site, where victory means beating the competition by a matter of seconds with a post that might yield gobs of traffic. This is why so many editors and writers at The Huffington Post remain at their desks during lunch and keep an eye on the web at all times. If, while you’re offline, three new Instagram filters are announced and you’re late to post the news, that’s a problem. ‘‘Just about everyone works continuously, whether you’re at the office or not,’’ one former employee said. ‘‘That little green light that says you’re available on Gchat is what matters.’’Slide ShowLow pay worsens the strain. One former employee said that some staff members take second jobs to cover their expenses. Some tutor; others wait on tables; others babysit. (A representative for The Huffington Post said the company was unaware of any moonlighting.) Many staff members rely on what has been called ‘‘HuffPost lunch’’ — Luna Bars, carrots, hummus, apples, bananas and sometimes string cheese, all served gratis in a kitchen area of the office.Inevitably, there is burnout. At the New York office, nearly two dozen employees have left since the start of this year, either because they were laid off or found more enticing and less hectic jobs. A Gawker post in early June, written by an anonymous former staff member, said the recent departures were hardly a surprise because the place has long been ‘‘so brutal and toxic it would meet with approval from committed sociopaths.’’A former editor told me about a period in 2013 when a series of departures left a cluster of empty desks along a wall that Huffington walks past on the way to her office. ‘‘Someone told my manager, ‘Arianna is really stressed out about the number of people leaving, so we need a bunch of people to sit at those desks in the path from the elevator to her office, to make her feel better,’ ’’ the former editor said. ‘‘So we sat there, waiting to say: ‘Hello! Greetings!’ as she walked by. It was supposed to be for two hours, but she got there at about 3 in the afternoon instead of 11 in the morning. It was absurd. I had to interrupt my workday because this woman was stressed out, because so many people had left, because they were stressed out.’’ (A Huffington Post representative denied this story, saying it was ‘‘clearly made up by someone with an ax to grind.’’)Staff members in Huffington’s inner circle must also contend with her superhuman endurance. Her oft-repeated claim to sleep eight hours a night notwithstanding, she rarely seems to be idle. Emails from her cease, several ex-employees told me, only between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m.There are staff members who have stuck it out for years and speak highly of the site as a place to work. They say they form lasting bonds with co-workers and relish the sense that they are writing for millions of readers. Some, like Daniel Koh, a former A-Teamer, speak with a reverence and fondness for Huffington herself. Koh described her as a perfectionist of exceptional intellectual wattage, a leader who never raises her voice and never holds a grudge. ‘‘Was it intense, and long hours, and did she teach me to maximize my workday?’’ he said. ‘‘Absolutely.’’But others who have worked closely with Huffington have found it a bruising experience, saying that she is perpetually on the lookout for signs of disloyalty, to a degree that bespeaks paranoia or, at the very least, pettiness. Employees cycle in and out of her favor, hailed as the site’s savior one moment, ignored the next. (The Gawker post called the office ‘‘essentially Soviet in its functioning.’’) ‘‘Everyone’s stock is shooting up or falling at any given moment, so everyone is rattled with uncertainty and insecurity,’’ one former employee said. ‘‘I’ve never seen anything like it.’’Advertisement Continue reading the main storyWhen I asked Huffington about criticisms of the newsroom, she was unmoved. She pointed to the nap rooms and breathing classes as evidence that she took employee well-being seriously. Only the voices of current employees were worth listening to, she cautioned, because the opinions of people who were laid off or left were likely to skew negative. I noted that she seemed unwilling to accept any responsibility for what a lot of former employees said was a vexing atmosphere.‘‘I’m definitely a work in progress,’’ she acknowledged. ‘‘I’m not by any means saying I’m perfect. But I feel very good about our culture here, because a lot of our top leaders have embraced it.’’The Huffington Post is hardly the only web media company with a reputation as an arduous place to work. Nor is Huffington the only editor in chief considered capricious and exasperating by employees. But she is surely the first described in those terms to install hammocks in a newsroom. Only someone with her unique combination of drive and outward placidity could run a tremendously popular, hugely productive website and then begin a second career chastening us for our addiction to the Internet. Somehow she has pulled it off. In her site’s parenting section, some of the most successful posts target moms who are checking their Facebook feeds late at night, apparently yearning to be told that they shouldn’t be on Facebook at that hour. ‘‘You know, posts about, ‘Stop procrastinating and go sleep,’ ‘Disconnect your devices,’ ’’ said Ethan Fedida, the site’s senior social media editor. ‘‘They go crazy for it.’’It’s as though Huffington is spreading an illness while simultaneously peddling the cure. Call it hypocrisy, but it testifies to her savvy. The business of web media is figuring out what people want — and if what we want is contradictory, why shouldn’t Huffington profit from that contradiction?Huffington may be engaged in a bit of wishful projection when she presents herself as an apostle of serenity. But it is a veneer she never drops, at least in public. At the Barnes & Noble event for ‘‘Thrive’’ last year, the one moderated by Katie Couric, a young woman rose during the question-and-answer session.‘‘What do you say to employers who are now seeking people specifically to work in social media?’’ she asked. ‘‘Our job is to be connected 24-7, where we have to manage your Facebook, your Instagram, your Twitter, your Pinterest. How do we detox when we’re told we have to be in the social-media revolution in order to earn our living?’’After thinking for a moment, Huffington suggested that she tell her employer that tweets can be scheduled in advance, so she doesn’t have to be awake at all hours. Remind your boss that people are paid for their judgment, Huffington added, not their endurance. Couric then asked the young woman, ‘‘You think your boss would be receptive to that?’’‘‘No,’’ she said, flatly.All eyes turned back to Huffington. Some bosses are toxic, she offered, so start looking for a new job. With a smile, she added: ‘‘We’re hiring.’’",business

"The idea of a publication of any new Michael Wolff book inevitably elicits discomfort in those likely to come into his line of fire. Mr. Wolff’s studied unpleasantness has emerged as a brand of sorts. USA Today has even capitalized on it, running an ad campaign for his column featuring a potential subject running away from his office via a rope and grappling hook just to avoid an interview with the feared columnist.The catalog of Michael Wolff feuds extends far beyond journalistic subjects. He has picked fights with restaurateurs, family members, other writers and a long list of former employers. The publishers of his latest book have gleefully played up this reputation by plastering his book jacket with ad hominem attacks by “Wolff’s enemies” using phrases such as “needy and amoral” and “mindless jerk.” And the blurb holds out the promise of vicious payback.Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your perspective, “Television Is the New Television: The Unexpected Triumph of Old Media in the Digital Age” (Portfolio/Penguin) fails to deliver on this threat. Although there is plenty of Mr. Wolff’s trademark snark, it is mostly a thoughtful essay on the state of the cultural and financial wars besieging a media industry in the midst of profound change.It would be a mistake to view the critic’s fear and loathing as merely a marketing gimmick. He is genuinely detested. I have been on friendly terms with Mr. Wolff for a number of years, and he has been, mostly, generous in his published references to my work. He even provided a short blurb for my first book, “The Accidental Investment Banker.”",business
"In the digital world, things change in an instant. One minute you are the people’s champion. In the next, perhaps a villain.European regulators said on Thursday that they were beginning an antitrust investigation into whether Amazon used its dominant position in the region’s e-books market to favor its own products over rivals.The announcement casts Amazon in a very different role from three years ago, when it prodded the United States Justice Department to file an antitrust suit against Apple and five leading publishers for conspiracy to fix e-book prices. That suit resulted in settlements from the publishers and a verdict against Apple, which it is appealing. Amazon was celebrated, and aggressively celebrated itself, as a hero for championing lower prices.Now the European Commission is evaluating the legality of clauses that Amazon used with European publishers, which required them to inform the e-commerce giant when they offered more favorable terms for books to other digital retailers. Since Amazon is by far the most powerful e-book retailer, such clauses might prevent an innovator from breaking through.",business
"ST. PETERSBURG, Russia — For a few days at least, profits seem to be trumping politics in Russia.On Thursday, Kremlin officials proclaimed their success in wooing at least 24 chief executives to attend an economic conference here, some arrived despite objections of their home governments.The three-day event, which runs through June 20, also drew Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, who had been talking to the Russian gas company Gazprom about pipeline deals to lift revenue for his debt-ridden country. Mr. Tsipras was expected to speak at the business gathering on Friday.Last year, American and some European chief executives largely boycotted the event, the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum. Showing up is not illegal under European Union rules and American sanctions imposed on Russia for annexing Crimea and supporting rebels in eastern Ukraine, but the White House has discouraged attendance.“Through our combined sanctions, restrictive measures and reduced diplomatic engagement, we have sent a clear signal to Russia’s leadership that we will not return to ‘business as usual,’ ” said a statement from United States government. “We have communicated our position to the U.S. business community in multiple fora.”",business
"Silicon Valley gets all the glory, but the real hotbed of American entrepreneurship appears to be a few hundred miles to the northeast: Montana.The state leads the nation in business creation, according to a new report from the Kauffman Foundation, which produces an annual analysis and ranking of start-up activity in every state. This year, the organization expanded its study to include the 40 largest metro areas. Austin, Tex., took the top spot in that ranking, followed by Miami. San Jose, Calif., a tech industry center, came in third.Kauffman’s data shows a heavy concentration of new business creation in the northern Mountain and Midwestern states. Why? Researchers point to the oil boom. The three states at the top of this year’s ranking — Montana, Wyoming and North Dakota — all touch the Bakken region, where a drilling frenzy brought a rush of development and thousands of new workers to once-sleepy towns, spawning entire industries. Oil- and gas-related start-ups are piling into the region, but so are restaurants, day care centers, breweries, equipment makers, clothing retailers, transportation businesses and an array of other ventures.To create its ranking, Kauffman combines several economic measures, including the number of adults in an area who start businesses each month. In Montana, that rate is 540 for every 100,000 residents, nearly twice the national average.",business
"MEAN bosses could have killed my father. I vividly recall walking into a hospital room outside of Cleveland to see my strong, athletic dad lying with electrodes strapped to his bare chest. What put him there? I believe it was work-related stress. For years he endured two uncivil bosses.Rudeness and bad behavior have all grown over the last decades, particularly at work. For nearly 20 years I’ve been studying, consulting and collaborating with organizations around the world to learn more about the costs of this incivility. How we treat one another at work matters. Insensitive interactions have a way of whittling away at people’s health, performance and souls.Robert M. Sapolsky, a Stanford professor and the author of “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers,” argues that when people experience intermittent stressors like incivility for too long or too often, their immune systems pay the price. We also may experience major health problems, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and ulcers.Intermittent stressors — like experiencing or witnessing uncivil incidents or even replaying one in your head — elevate levels of hormones called glucocorticoids throughout the day, potentially leading to a host of health problems, including increased appetite and obesity. A study published in 2012 that tracked women for 10 years concluded that stressful jobs increased the risk of a cardiovascular event by 38 percent.",business
"That has been one of the biggest concerns for regulators trying to write rules. Small companies are inherently risky investments — only half survive for five years, according to government data — and private businesses are not required to disclose much about how they operate. It can be nearly impossible for potential investors to really know what risks they face.Some rely on an old-fashioned kind of due diligence: community reputation. Staci Fritz, a Madison resident who invested $4,000 in MobCraft, runs her own food business in the area, Calliope Ice Cream. “I see the MobCraft guys out at all these local events; I know how hard they’re working it,” she said. “Their beer is amazing, and people here love their concept. I don’t see how it could fail.”While state officials are bullish on equity crowdfunding, entrepreneurs and investors have been slower to join in. Around 95 companies nationwide have filed applications to raise money using the state laws, according to data compiled by The New York Times from state regulators. Few states track how many businesses completed their offerings, or raised the sums they sought.In many states, businesses are encouraged — and in some cases, required — to advertise their offerings through online portals. Dozens have opened in the last year. In Texas, potential investors will be able buy their own piece of an oil well through Crudefunders and browse real estate deals on MassVenture. People interested in investing in restaurants can shop the listings on EquityEats (District of Columbia) and CraftFund (Wisconsin), while those looking to explore ventures in a variety of fields can peruse truCrowd (Texas), HoosierCrowd (Indiana), Michigan Funders and Hatch Oregon, among others.Nearly all of those sites, however, look like ghost towns. David Lilenfeld, who in 2013 created the nation’s first intrastate crowdfunding portal, SterlingFunder in Georgia, recently stopped accepting new equity crowdfunding deals on the site. In more than two years, only one of the companies he worked with raised the money it sought.“We’ve got all of the pieces in place except for one thing: the investors,” he said. “I think there’s a lack of awareness about equity crowdfunding from the target audience.”",business
"LONDON — European officials approved on Tuesday a series of sweeping changes to how mobile and wired Internet service works in the region, pushing through rules that outlaw mobile roaming charges and forbid providers from giving preferences to some types of online traffic.As part of the new rules, which are expected to be officially approved by European governments over the next few months, officials here banned cellphone roaming charges, beginning in 2017, when people travel across the 28-member European Union. The changes also outline how Internet service providers must treat data over their networks, forbidding broadband providers from slowing down any particular service.The changes are part of long-awaited overhauls aimed at improving how Europeans connect to and use mobile services. Lawmakers say they want the new rules to foster greater economic activity in the European Union, which in many ways is still divided by national boundaries.Debate about the new rules, more than two years in the making, has pitted many of the region’s telecommunications operators against consumer groups. To appease both sides, lawmakers here hailed cuts in cellphone roaming charges while allowing companies to potentially charge extra for access to their networks under certain circumstances.",business
"Yet founders don’t always consider what their adult children might want. Is running the family business something they are interested in or would be good at? Should they join the business at a young age or be encouraged to find work elsewhere first and apply to the company later? And how can children who do not want to be in the family business tell their parents without seeming ungrateful for all that the business has afforded them, or worse, being shunned?“What amazes me is the number of families that get to the designation point and the person looks up and says, ‘I don’t want it,’ ” said Stephen Salley, a partner at Banyan Family Business Advisors. “Even the most successful of businesses have these blind spots. It’s shocking how many families don’t talk about this.”There are consultants who advise families on their businesses, addressing, among other topics, how to have the open discussions. Their recommendations are sensible.The first step: talk early and often about the business. These conversations are not just about what parents do and what the businesses produce; they are about how founders think about the future of their businesses — what will happen after they retire — and about the roles, if any, children want or are suited for.“The best-case scenario is parents say, ‘This business may or may not be an opportunity for you; you have to earn it and maybe come back after having been successful in another business,’ ” said Michael A. Klein, a clinical psychologist who works with family businesses and the author of “Trapped in the Family Business: A Practical Guide to Uncovering and Managing This Hidden Dilemma.”",business
"A popular government-backed small-business lending program, suspended last week after reaching its limit for the year, is on the verge of restarting.The House on Monday approved a bill with an amendment that lifts the Small Business Administration’s lending cap for its largest loan guarantee program to a record $23.5 billion. The bill, passed by the Senate on Thursday, awaits President Obama’s signature.Small business lenders say they expect the program to be back in business by the end of the week. More than 1,100 potential borrowers have submitted applications that are on hold until lending resumes. Those in the industry say the heavy demand is a sign of small businesses confidence in a strengthening economy.“This is a good problem to have,” said Tony Wilkinson, president of the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders, an industry trade group. “It’s a good economic sign that businesses are willing to borrow again.”",business
"Demand for government-backed small-business loans is at a record high, but the momentum came to an abrupt halt last week when the agency that guarantees those loans reached its limit for the year and suspended its program.But potential borrowers were pinning their hopes on a House vote on Monday that would allow the lending to resume.The freeze was put in place for the first time in a decade — other than during government shutdowns — when the Small Business Administration hit its limit of $18.75 billion for 2015.More than 900 applicants were awaiting loan guarantee approvals.Although it is likely that Congress will approve a higher cap, the fact that the agency’s cap was reached so early in the year indicates how heavy the demand for small-business loans has become, despite relatively small, shaky signs of growth in the larger economy.",business

"LONDON — European antitrust officials filed formal charges against MasterCard on Thursday, accusing the company of setting artificially high fees for credit card transactions in the European Union, which ultimately may have hurt consumers.The European Commission, the bloc’s executive arm, said MasterCard had prevented some retailers from processing transactions in countries with lower fees. The commission also said that MasterCard’s fees were unfair to tourists traveling in Europe.“We currently suspect MasterCard is artificially raising the costs of card payments, which would harm consumers and retailers in the E.U.,” Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s top antitrust official, said in a statement on Thursday.If found to have breached the region’s rules, MasterCard could face fines of up to 10 percent of its worldwide revenue, which was about $10 billion last year.

"To the Editor:“A Less Credible Euro” (editorial, July 26) rightly rejects calls by Hans-Werner Sinn (Op-Ed, July 25), Paul Krugman (column, July 6) and others for Greek exit from monetary union. But you, too, overstate the case for monetary, fiscal and exchange-rate flexibility for a country like Greece.“Internal devaluation” has already been extreme, with a 30 percent fall in real wages. Export response has been anemic, because of the structure of the Greek economy and trade. Yet Professor Sinn thinks that impoverishment must go much further.Monetary union had design flaws, especially vulnerability to financial instability. And the absence of a common budget and other risk-sharing mechanisms underlies the fiscal conservatism that brought the highly contractionary policies favored by Professor Sinn and led by Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister.Fiscal consolidation was needed, but the extent and speed were counterproductive. With deep recessions, debt burdens rose.",business

"The Roosevelt-sponsored Bank Act of 1935 created a new Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and allocated most of the Fed’s authority to that publicly accountable board. It also remade the Federal Open Market Committee, a panel created just two years earlier to coordinate monetary policy. The original committee excluded the public’s representatives and consisted only of all 12 Federal Reserve Banks. The new committee reduced the banks’ voting membership to five (a compromise by the Roosevelt administration, which wanted to exclude them from national policy making altogether); the seven new members of the Board of Governors would become the majority of the committee.This is essentially the Fed’s structure today. In good times, few people care much about the Fed. Since the financial crisis of 2007-9, though, critics on the left and the right have savaged the Fed. Those on the left say the Fed is too cozy with the banks it regulates, too willing to surrender regulatory scrutiny in the name of financial stability. Those on the right complain that its postcrisis monetary policies — eight years of holding down interest rates to near zero, amassing huge portfolios of government and mortgage-backed securities to spur bank lending — are ad hoc and inflationary, and not grounded in good economic theory. Both critiques agree that the Fed wields too much power behind a veil of secrecy.Janet L. Yellen, the Fed’s chairwoman, says the criticism is misplaced. The Fed is already transparent, and subjecting it to ever-greater Congressional scrutiny will only interfere with the institution’s role as a neutral overseer of the economy.But critics and Fed officials are missing the bigger problem: the problem of governance. We should return to the unfinished business of the New Deal and simplify the Fed’s governance so that the public knows who is making the decisions at this singularly important institution.The focus should be on removing the quasi-autonomy of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks, also called the regional Feds. Their presidents, who are chosen through a complicated and byzantine process that reflects regional economic interests, should no longer serve on the Federal Open Market Committee.",business
"The business of daily fantasy sports is only a few years old, but it has become a nearly ubiquitous presence. The leaders, FanDuel and DraftKings, have created a new advertising category, spending millions of dollars on TV commercials with no end in sight. Their names and logos are seen in stadiums and arenas thanks to their many sponsorship deals.Yet they’re really just youthful start-ups, still raising money to build their war chests and beat each other silly for market supremacy, still looking for the best ways to lure fans to play their games.“We’re a purpose-driven company,” Matt King, the chief financial officer of FanDuel, said during a recent interview at the company’s offices in Manhattan. “Our purpose is to make sports more exciting.”That excitement has its roots in the Rotisserie baseball concept that turned into the fantasy sports business: Fans will be interested in more than just their favorite teams if they pay to play games with lineups of their own making, stocked with players from various teams. But unlike season-long fantasy games, which can be a slog, daily fantasy exploits desires for instant gratification and easy money. One game leads to more games and invitations from the companies to return again and again. Professional football is by far the most popular fantasy sport.",business
"BUT for starters, as anyone who has been to a funeral knows, to contemplate any death is also to remember a life, and how it intertwined with and influenced one’s own. I was sad to learn that the writer William Zinsser passed away in May at age 92. But what a life! I worked with him as a young editor years ago, and kept in casual touch for a while afterward: I went to see him play piano, we corresponded about sheet music, that sort of thing. He was a master of the craft, as you’d expect from the author of “On Writing Well,” but what sticks with me is how profoundly kind and generous he was to such a minor acquaintance. He was an example of how to be; any prompt to remember him, I’ll take.Less sentimentally, there’s Gore Vidal. As a longtime fan, I lament his absence. His entry in my address book, however, consists of a fax number in Italy that worked in 1999. I know it worked because I used it to try to persuade him to write an essay for The New York Times Magazine, where I was then an editor. His response came in a 3 a.m. message on my home answering machine, dismissing the idea, my employer and me. Colorfully. Clearly there’s no sensible reason to save this contact, but whenever I stumble upon it I know: I’ll never be able to take that out.I’ve picked a couple of familiar names to make a point that applies to the many contacts in my address book that you would not recognize. Each brings to mind memories that I welcome, even those who died far too young. And while I’m publicly skeptical of the theory that digital technology usefully allows us to offload our memories, I secretly worry that it’s true enough to make deleting contacts feel a bit like shredding pages of a diary, or even zapping cells from my brain.Or maybe something even more troubling: The convenient-by-design act of deleting the name of a dead friend with a simple tap or click can feel like overtly participating in removing that person from the world.Not long after I read that Steve Jobs anecdote, Grantland posted a short video in which Gay Talese thumbed through, and discussed, his address book. Of course it’s not digital (in fact, it’s leatherbound), but it dates back more than 50 years, and its pages are a gorgeous jumble of handwriting, cross-outs and even paper scraps of new information taped over old entries. The author reads out some celebrated names from this de facto record of personal encounters and professional curiosity. Some, naturally, are dead. “I make a point of not erasing names, as a rule,” he remarks. “I don’t think that it’s ethical to erase the past.”My address book lacks the aesthetic charisma of Mr. Talese’s analog object, just as any given Pinterest board is less fascinating and visually distinct than your grandmother’s adolescent scrapbook. Contacts software is designed for efficiency and ease of use, not emotional evocation or stealth autobiography. But Mr. Talese’s point holds true for my digital object anyway: “Those people listed in that book have next to nothing in common with any other person in that book,” he observes, “except through me.” For this reason, among others: “That book is a connection to my whole life.”Mr. Talese has lived a singular life. But then again, haven’t we all? And while for someone my age the urge to preserve a digital address book is tied to memories of physical reference points for personal objects (a clothbound volume, ink on paper), a young person today is collecting what could be a contact list that will reach back to childhood. It seems to me that even a simple ledger of everyone you’ve ever known is actually an amazing thing, whether anybody gets around to filming you scrolling through it or not.",business

"Henry Blodget was seen as a pariah after the dot-com boom. The digital media boom has been much kinder.On Tuesday, it was announced that Business Insider, the online publication he founded in 2007, had sold a controlling stake to the German media conglomerate Axel Springer for $343 million. Mr. Blodget declined, in an interview, to say how much money he personally made from the deal. But it was most likely more of a windfall than he could have reasonably expected 12 years ago.In 2003, after leaving his job as a senior Internet analyst at Merrill Lynch, he agreed to pay $4 million to settle accusations that he had promoted some companies’ stock in public while disparaging them in private. As part of the agreement, he was barred from the securities industry for life.“I don’t see today as a redemption,” Mr. Blodget, 49, said by phone Tuesday, adding that he had worked daily, with others willing to give him a chance, to rebuild trust. “But I did have a tremendous fall.

"The Business Insider boss Henry Blodget is living up to his company’s name.He has struck a deal to sell the business and tech news website to the German publisher Axel Springer at a $442 million valuation. That implies an implausibly long run of improbably fast growth. The lofty expectations evoke Dresdner Bank’s acquisition of Wasserstein Perella.Landing Business Insider is a consolation prize for the $5.7 billion Axel Springer, whose brands include the popular tabloid newspaper Bild. It was knocked out of the July bidding for The Financial Times at the 11th hour by Nikkei. The Japanese company offered $1.3 billion, or a little more than two-and-a-half times The Financial Times’s sales last year.Axel Springer is paying 13 times Business Insider’s 2014 sales of $34 million, based on comments that Mr. Blodget made this year. Business Insider, the producer of things as diverse as stories about luxury watches on eBay and tips from the bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach, may be on track for a top line of $50 million this year, making the multiple more like nine times.Even so, at the minimum 30 percent annualized growth that Axel Springer projects for Business Insider, it would take another five years to generate $190 million in revenue, roughly a third of The Financial Times’s top line in 2014. That’s a long time to wait for a purchase to grow into the same price-to-sales ratio. The Financial Times sells subscriptions, but for now at least, Business Insider largely depends on the less reliable online ad revenue. And The Financial Times is profitable, while Axel Springer doesn’t expect Business Insider to break even until 2018.",business

"Alstom’s power unit makes equipment for generating and distributing electricity for utilities across the globe.But the main prize for G.E. is Alstom’s heavy-duty gas turbines business, which holds lucrative contracts worldwide for servicing installed power plants. Because G.E. is already the world leader in that field, its main rival in Europe, Siemens, had argued to antitrust officials that the deal would leave too much of that market in the hands of the American company.On Tuesday, a Siemens spokesman, Alexander Becker, declined to comment.The Alstom assets to be hived off to Ansaldo include two models of gas turbines and various service contracts in Europe. Ansaldo will also buy Alstom’s Power Systems Manufacturing unit, which makes parts for servicing gas turbines.Ms. Vestager said at Tuesday’s news conference that the conditions she had agreed to with G.E. were meant to foster the emergence of another European energy technology company.“For us it was very important that a strategic part of the Alstom business was divested and here we have an upfront buyer in Ansaldo, an Italian company,” Ms. Vestager said. “We find that even if Ansaldo is not the strongest player in the market right now, this gives them a fighting chance and it ensures competition in the European market for heavy-duty gas turbines,” she said.Steven Winoker, an analyst at Bernstein, estimated that the assets G.E. was selling to Ansaldo generated about $300 million in annual revenue.“The E.U. needed to have a viable third competitor,” he said, and Ansaldo, though currently a relatively small player, is obtaining assets that “at least gives them a shot at building that business.”",business
"Expanding the article into this book, Slaughter addresses some of her critics. Among them were men pointing out that they too feel torn between work and home. Now, instead of talking about work-family tension as a problem for women, she urges readers to see caregiving and paid work as two kinds of vital human activities that can be done by either men or women. Same-sex parents have to negotiate responsibilities without default gender roles, and Slaughter hopes straight couples will do the same. For now, though, whichever partner takes the primary caregiving role unfortunately has to be prepared for some loss in social status. While caregiving and paid work are equally important for families and society, they are not yet equally valued. The example of same-sex couples “lays bare another fact and fissure in our society”: Regardless of gender, “the person in a couple who stays home will be valued less than the person who goes to the office.”And if you don’t work in an office? Slaughter’s Atlantic article was criticized by some readers for focusing on a relatively small number of affluent workers, while ignoring the much larger group of working women in retail and service jobs. In “Unfinished Business,” she seeks a conceptual framework for understanding the problems of working women at all wage levels: “What unites all women is the struggle to combine competition and care in a system that rewards one and penalizes the other.”The problem of caregiving certainly concerns women at all income levels, but it doesn’t only unite them — it brings some of them into economic conflict with others, an obvious point of tension that gets lost in Slaughter’s emphasis on women’s common ground. However much they may be sympathetic to the concerns of domestic workers and day care staff, working women at all wage levels have an obvious financial interest in child-care fees staying low, which results in a group of underpaid workers taking care of other women’s children and elderly relatives. Slaughter would like to see caregiving become a professionalized, middle-class occupation: “We should think about paid care work, from home health service to therapy to teaching, the same way we think about any other profession, including money management.” But how to get there, given that, in a monetary sense, most workers simply can’t afford to value child care very highly?The last chapter of “Unfinished Business” presents a wish list of public policy changes that would enable parents to meet family responsibilities without jeopardizing their jobs or careers. Slaughter draws on the work of Ai-jen Poo, the director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, to propose “an infrastructure of care” for American workers. At the top of the list is “high-quality and affordable” child care — presumably subsidized by either employer or government — which only a tiny number of American employers (including the military) currently offer. It’s hard to think of anything that would benefit women up and down the wage scale — including day care workers themselves — more quickly and effectively than subsidized high-quality day care with a sliding-scale fee system. Once you expand the discussion of workplace policy to include women at all wage levels, the most useful solutions seem to be political ones — some combination of expanded workers’ rights, workplace regulations, higher minimum-wage levels, incentives for businesses to cover employee benefits, or portable benefits packages untethered to employment — and one regrets that collective, policy-based solutions are more or less confined to the last chapter of Slaughter’s book. In the rest of “Unfinished Business,” Slaughter’s appeal is often to an unspecified “we” who “should” make some sort of change, but the language obscures exactly what is to be changed — government regulations? the tax code? workplace policies? individual behavior? attitudes? — how this change might come about and who stands to gain or lose.The idea of winners and losers seems a sticky one for “Unfinished Business.” The workplace landscape Slaughter describes is not obviously a theater of competing economic interests. She cites research of the “everybody wins” variety showing that shorter, more flexible hours and generous family leaves benefit both companies and employees: “In general, your boss wants you to be the best employee you can be, and that means making you a happy employee.” Yet while there’s an abundance of evidence suggesting that workers do better in a humane working environment, many companies have clearly been using a wholly different calculus to determine their labor policies, especially at the low-wage end of the spectrum: shedding full-time workers for “independent contractors” who don’t get benefits; subjecting employees to unpredictable, less-than-full-time schedules; counting every bathroom break or expecting workers to answer emails 24/7; and sending jobs at all skill levels abroad. Slaughter herself mentions several typical cases of punitive working conditions at retail chains, with unpredictable schedules that make finding child care a nightmare and summary firings for missing a single day of work because of illness or school closing.",business

"After careful study, Professors Padavic, Ely and Reid found that an equal number of men and women had left the firm in the preceding three years, a simple fact that contradicted management’s women, work and family story. Some of the men also left because of the long hours; others “suffered in silence or otherwise made do.” The firm’s key human resources problem was not gender, as management believed, but rather a culture of overwork.The firm’s leadership resisted these findings. They didn’t want to be told that they needed to overhaul their entire organizational philosophy or that they were overpromising to clients and overdelivering (for example, making hundred-slide PowerPoint presentations that the client couldn’t even use). They wanted to be told that the firm’s problem was work-family conflict for women, a narrative that would allow them to adopt a set of policies specifically aimed at helping women work part time, or be mentored, or join support networks. As Professors Padavic, Ely and Reid wryly concluded, their attitude “required a rejection of evidence on the part of evidence-driven analysts.”Bad work culture is everyone’s problem, for men just as much as for women. It’s a problem for working parents, not just working mothers. For working children who need time to take care of their own parents, not just working daughters. For anyone who does not have the luxury of a full-time lead parent or caregiver at home.But there’s good news. Men are also beginning to ask for and take paternity leave and to take lead parent roles. According to a continuing study by the Families and Work Institute, only a third of employed millennial men think that couples should take on traditional gender roles. Some tech companies warring for talent are also beginning to compete by offering longer paternity leaves, which will hardly affect the average American workplace, but is a sign of changing cultural attitudes.EVEN if men and women join forces to demand changes in the workplace, though, we cannot do this alone, as individuals trying to make our lives work and as workers and bosses trying to make room for care. Some other company can always keep prices down by demanding more, burning out its employees and casting them aside when they are done. To be fully competitive as a country, we are going to have to emulate other industrialized countries and build an infrastructure of care. We used to have one; it was called women at home. But with 57 percent of those women in the labor force, that infrastructure has crumbled and it’s not coming back.To support care just as we support competition, we will need some combination of the following: high-quality and affordable child care and elder care; paid family and medical leave for women and men; a right to request part-time or flexible work; investment in early education comparable to our investment in elementary and secondary education; comprehensive job protection for pregnant workers; higher wages and training for paid caregivers; community support structures to allow elders to live at home longer; and reform of elementary and secondary school schedules to meet the needs of a digital rather than an agricultural economy.These proposals are not so far-fetched as they may seem. President Obama put forward proposals to expand access to affordable, high-quality child care in his 2016 budget. Hillary Rodham Clinton has made providing a foundation for working families, including child care, one of the central aspects of her campaign. One of the few states that offers paid family leave (workers pay the cost out of a small increase in their payroll tax) is New Jersey, under the Republican governor Chris Christie.",business
"Airbus said Monday it was in talks with Iran toward the sale of dozens of new commercial aircraft — part of a number of international business deals likely to flow toward Iran since it agreed to curtail its nuclear ambitions.It represents the first wave of a broad rethinking of the Iranian market by Western businesses after they were banned from doing business there for nearly two decades. The nuclear deal led to the lifting of crippling economic sanctions on Iran that have left Tehran with a long shopping list, from planes to cars to oil-field equipment.Iran’s transportation minister, Abbas Akhoondi, announced the Airbus developments at an aviation event in Tehran, saying that the country had been in talks for nearly a year to buy planes ranging from 100-seat turboprops to the 555-seat twin-deck Airbus A380 superjumbo. However, “there was no way to pay for them because of banking sanctions,” Mr. Akhoondi said, according to state news media.Companies have long been anticipating returning to Iran, with its 81 million, mostly young consumers who have already shown an avid taste for smuggled Western cigarettes and Apple electronics. Bootleg versions of Western restaurants abound in Iranian cities, from “Pizza Hat” to “Mash Donald’s.”",business
"Two final notes.First, in case you’re wondering, Kroenke and the Rams are not getting a penny in public money from Inglewood, Los Angeles or California, even though the stadium they are building is quite likely to cost more than $2 billion. This may seem astounding, given their demands in St. Louis, but it’s not. The Inglewood stadium has the potential to be far more profitable than any new stadium in St. Louis. And St. Louis never had the real estate possibilities that Inglewood does. In St. Louis, Kroenke was the owner of the Rams. In Inglewood, Kroenke will be the owner of the Rams plus the developer of a retail and entertainment complex that Jones has described as Disneyland for professional football. Kroenke is putting up $800 million in equity. That’s what developers do. Not that he’s going to go broke if it turns out he made a bad bet.Second, there is the question of what is going to happen to the other two teams vying for Los Angeles, the Chargers and the Raiders. The two teams jointly put their chips on a different site near Los Angeles, in nearby Carson. They lost. One of them will almost surely become a tenant of Kroenke’s in Inglewood; Kroenke envisions having two teams play in his new $2 billion sandbox.It is not likely to be a pleasant prospect. Kroenke is a tough negotiator, and he will also be able to maximize the value of his stadium in a way that his tenant will not. Dean A. Spanos, the San Diego Chargers’ chairman, in particular finds himself in a terrible spot. For some 14 years, he has been trying to get a new stadium built in San Diego. He’s gotten nowhere, and his constant agitation over the issue has made him a pariah in San Diego.",business
"Volkswagen on Tuesday named a former BMW executive to oversee its business in the United States, Canada and Mexico, where sales have been particularly hard hit by an emissions scandal that has placed the company under intense pressure from regulators.The new executive, Hinrich J. Woebcken, 55, will become head of the North America region for Volkswagen brand cars effective April 1, the company said Tuesday. Michael Horn, who has been chief executive of Volkswagen’s United States unit and who is popular with dealers, will remain in that post, the company said.The appointment addresses a leadership vacuum in the region at a time when Volkswagen sorely needs to repair its relations with customers and the authorities. American state attorneys general have complained that the company has not cooperated fully with investigations of who was responsible for installing software designed to mask the true emissions of cars with diesel motors.In addition, Volkswagen has not yet been able to agree with the Environmental Protection Agency and California regulators on a way to fix about 600,000 vehicles that have the illegal software.",business
"Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, said on Friday that it had terminated an agreement to sell a controlling stake in its automotive and LED components business because of regulatory concerns raised in the United States. A group led by GO Scale Capital, an investment fund sponsored by GSR Ventures of China and Oak Investment Partners, agreed in March to acquire an 80.1 percent stake in the Philips unit, called Lumileds, for as much as $2.9 billion. Philips combined the lighting and LED components operations into a stand-alone company in 2014. Philips said in October that the closing of the deal was “uncertain” after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an interagency body that includes representatives from the Treasury and Justice Departments, raised “unforeseen concerns” about the deal. GO Scale Capital has offices in Beijing, Hong Kong and California. It has said that its goal is to “scale up its investments in China for global markets.”",business
"LONDON — When it was announced last Friday, Google’s agreement to pay 130 million pounds in back taxes was welcomed by the country’s chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, as a “major success.”Less than a week later, few are saying that of the deal, which has put Prime Minister David Cameron’s government on the defensive.Google’s $185 million settlement, announced last week, covers a 10-year period beginning in 2005 and was the result of a six-year inquiry by the British tax authorities. The agreement has been questioned by both the opposition Labour Party and by Conservative politicians including Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, and Steve Baker, a member of Parliament.Mr. Baker said the tax accord, while lawful and involving a substantial sum, was still “derisory” and “completely unacceptable to the public.”",business
"Just as the holiday shopping season neared, a toy company, Rokenbok Education, was navigating a nightmare situation: Its database files had been infected by malware.Online criminals had encrypted company files, making them unusable, and were demanding a hefty ransom to unlock the data. Rokenbok, a California-based company that uses building blocks and even robotics to teach children how to think like engineers, lost thousands of dollars in sales in two days.Rokenbok’s founder and executive director, Paul Eichen, was already struggling to adapt his seven-employee company to a fast-changing toy world. Even worse, the malware attack was not Rokenbok’s first. The company had been hit earlier with a denial of service attack that shut down the company’s website.“I sweated that one,” Mr. Eichen said. “Customers’ first impressions are critical.”Focusing on revenue over protection is far from unusual for small companies like Rokenbok. But it is an increasingly dangerous path, experts say.

"The website has seed funding from the Arts Council, which invests government funds and National Lottery proceeds, and quickly drew the support of Ed Vaizey, the minister of state for culture and the digital economy. He noted that creative industries are the fastest-growing force in the British economy, pumping almost 80 billion pounds, or about $113 billion, into the country’s economy a year, accounting for 6 percent of British jobs and growing three times faster than any other sector.Mr. Vaizey added that he “hadn’t thought twice” about whether to host the event at the prime minister’s office, a gesture that he said was “a clear sign of our commitment to the movement, and the confident, empowered community it is trying to create for creatives across the U.K.”Mr. Cameron, although otherwise occupied in Switzerland, had prepared a statement to show his support for the project, too: “From Asia to America, they’re dancing to our music, watching our films and wearing our designers’ latest creations,” the statement said. “With all this talent, it’s no wonder that our creative industries form the fastest-growing part of the economy.”“I want us to build on that,” he continued. “And that means backing the best entrepreneurship in the sector, providing a focal point for the start-up support and resources creative people need. Creative Entrepreneurs does just that — and its website is the first of its kind. I hope this, alongside the other measures we are taking to boost businesses, will help make one of this country’s great success stories go from strength to strength.”The Conservative government, while traditionally an advocate for small businesses, has come under fire in recent months for policies that could have a negative impact on creative sectors, in which starting salaries remain low. For example, beginning in April, workers from outside the European Union who have lived in Britain for five years or more will have to prove annual earnings of at least £35,000 to stay in the country legally. And as a referendum looms on whether Britain should stay in the European Union, creative leaders have been quick to emphasize the importance of funding from the bloc and of ease of mobility for young artists between countries all of which could be lost if voters were to choose to leave the union.",business
"John Leonard is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who roots for the Philadelphia Eagles, listens to sports talk radio when he is exercising, and teaches a course called Measurement and Instrumentation. When the Deflategate story broke after last year’s A.F.C. championship game between the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts, he found himself fixated on it, yearning to dig into it from a scientific point of view.On the off chance you have spent the last year on Mars, Deflategate refers to the scandal that ensued after the Colts accused the Patriots of deflating their footballs to give quarterback Tom Brady an unfair edge — an accusation that the N.F.L. and its commissioner, Roger Goodell, ultimately determined was probably true.“Of course, I thought of the Ideal Gas Law right away,” Leonard says, “but there was no data to test it.” Although the N.F.L. had measured the pounds per square inch (p.s.i.) of the Patriots’ footballs at halftime after the Colts complained — under the rules, game balls must be inflated to pressures ranging from 12.5 to 13.5 p.s.i. — it had not released any numbers.The Ideal Gas Law, in case you are wondering, sets out the expected behavior of gases under certain conditions, like changes in temperature or volume. For instance, gases contract when they are in cold air and expand when they are in warmer temperatures. “I’m always looking for real life examples for my students,” Leonard says. If he could get some data, Deflategate had great potential as a case study.",business
"Joe Nocera is the new sports business columnist for The New York Times.I wrote my first article for The New York Times about the N.C.A.A. four years ago. Appearing in the magazine, it was headlined “Let’s Start Paying College Athletes.” Although I had been a college basketball fan all my life, I had never paid much attention to the inner workings of the N.C.A.A. But my research woke me up to the inequities faced by college football and men’s basketball players, and compelled me to begin writing regularly about how the N.C.A.A. and the college sports establishment exploit the players who generate the billions that the grown-ups pocket.The conceit for the original article was to imagine that the N.C.A.A.’s “amateurism” model — which, of course, enables that exploitation — had magically disappeared, finally allowing athletes to be paid. My charge was to devise a scheme that would divert some revenue to them without bankrupting university athletic departments or destroying the fabric of college sports. What I came up with was a system that revolved around a salary cap. It also had a handful of other facets, which I’ll get to shortly.Although the N.C.A.A. had its critics four years ago, they were neither as numerous nor as visible as they are today. The O’Bannon lawsuit against the N.C.A.A. was years from being adjudicated. The college sports reform movement hadn’t yet coalesced. The most prominent voice then calling for players to be paid was Taylor Branch, who had published a seminal article, “The Shame of College Sports,” in The Atlantic just a few months before my piece in The Times Magazine.Over the next few years, however, the N.C.A.A.’s issues became part of the zeitgeist. As that happened, a raging debate developed about whether — and how — to pay the players. The ESPN college basketball analyst Jay Bilas, for instance, advocates a free-market approach, saying that athletes should reap whatever the market will bear. Others promote the so-called Olympic model, in which players would generate income from endorsements, autographs, jobs, and control of their image and likeness.",business
"James Hamilton’s “A Strange Business” — the title is taken from an observation about the art market made late in life by the brilliant British painter J. M. W. Tur­ner — is every bit as quirky a book as you might expect from a onetime fellow at St. Antony’s College, Oxford. It has 31 pages of endnotes; a 14-page index; and six pages of bibliography, in reduced type, including a section for primary source material, one for secondary source material and another for “manuscripts consulted.” There are also four tiny-type pages devoted to recounting for the befuddled reader the names of the 180 or so “Dramatis Personae” that get name-checked continually, from George Ackermann, the art dealer and publisher, to John Young, the ­engraver and curator.Alas, what Hamilton has not provided sufficiently in this rather arid accounting of the intersection between art and commerce in 19th-century London is much of a compelling narrative. With all the characters whizzing by after their brief cameos, there is regrettably no through-line, no single man or woman whose gripping story of overcoming adversity or besting an adversary will keep a reader turning these pages. Beyond the rather simple observation that people with money are the ones buying art, and always have been, Hamilton does little to help illuminate what alchemical mix of wealth, taste, status and patronage came together in London some 200 years ago that vastly improved the lives of some artists but not others.It would have been a delight had Hamilton, now the university curator and honorary reader in the history of art at the University of Birmingham in England, given us a more sumptuous rendering of, for instance, the businessman and patron of the arts Benjamin Windus. An heir to his paternal grandfather’s coach-building business, Windus also had gobs of money coming his way from a spirits business his maternal grandfather had started. Known as Godfrey’s Cordial, the drink the family manufactured was “a mixture of opium, treacle, brandy, caraway and spices” and was prescribed for “fretful babies (and their mothers),” Hamilton writes. The cordial was known around town as “Mother’s Friend.” Without much elaboration, other than the apparent fact Windus disliked the cordial business as much as “the medicine he manufactured,” we are told that the business was sold and that Windus “managed to live his collecting life on the proceeds of both cordial and carriages, and from his directorship of Globe Insurance,” and about which there is little more.Windus was quite the collector. He started buying Turner’s watercolors when he was young and later filled his grand library with more than 160 of them, as well as dozens of pieces by other water­colorists. We learn, in passing, from Hamilton that Windus “was generous and welcoming in allowing visitors to see the collection, by ticket, on Tuesdays.” A fuller picture of this man — and why he sold the family business and devoted himself to collecting — would have been most welcome. (Apparently the morphine in Godfrey’s Cordial would often sink to the bottom of containers, leading to problematic addictions for children who were given virtually straight morphine — but this interesting fact was not supplied by Hamilton.)",business
"LONDON — Tata Steel of India agreed on Monday to sell part of its British business to the investment firm Greybull Capital, preventing thousands of job losses and freeing it up to focus on the sale of its other big plant in Britain.The British government has been under pressure to ensure that the Tata plants are sold rather than shut down after the steel maker, one of the world’s biggest, said on March 30 that it would sell its unprofitable British business, possibly putting 15,000 jobs at risk.Greybull said it would buy Tata’s Long Products Europe division in Scunthorpe, in Northern England, which employs 4,400 people.

"Q. What kind of social enterprises have you started?A. Eight years ago, I approached Vivocity (a Singapore shopping mall) and asked them to give me space where I could help disadvantaged people who make handicrafts sell their work during the first and last weekend of the month — because in Singapore, that’s payday and people are more likely to be willing to part with money to buy a little something. I think we all need a space where we can buy, sell and trade.I think that every shopping mall in the world should have this marketplace concept, maybe just two days a month, and allow the marginalized and artisans to showcase and sell their products.More recently I invested into an app called FastFast Delivery. It’s like an Uber for courier service. I got the idea because I sit on many boards, and they need me to sign lots of documents. My staff is always tracking me down, and I thought, wouldn’t it be nice to just have those papers delivered wherever I am that day, and give an opportunity to people who are currently unemployed or maybe retired and need a bit more cash? So I found someone, my co-founder, who could create the platform, and since we launched last August, we’ve had about 900 drivers who signed up. I set it up thinking this would primarily be used by individuals like myself, but what we’ve found is that our top clients are actually hotel concierges and small business, like florists, cookie shops that just want something delivered immediately.Q. What advice would you give to a young social entrepreneur?A. I think today’s young people do have a heart and want to do good, but if you want to succeed that’s not enough. You also need to think through your financial model. So my advice: Before launching yourself into a business, get some experience, do volunteering work. Many youngsters today have been raised on handouts from their parents and they need to build some inner core strength. They can’t take stress, because they’ve never really experienced hardship, they’ve never experienced failure; their parents have always been there to help. To build a muscle you need to train it regularly; it’s the same in business. You will have issues coming your way every day, and that’s something you need to learn to deal with so it doesn’t become stressful.What you learn early on will be valuable lessons. My grandparents owned a dispensary clinic and I was always there, doing magic to entertain people waiting. In primary Grade 4, I started reselling 3-D cards for someone else at school. I’d make about 20-30 percent on each card and I learned to save that money, and then give it away. I think it’s good to let children experience how to make money from an early age and encourage them to give back.Q. You play a role as a mentor to many youngsters. Did you have a good mentor yourself?A. Along my journey I’ve had different mentors, business mentors and spiritual, but the greatest mentor I’ve ever had has been my mom. She always brings me back to ground. She has never been the one who says, “Go for it at all cost.” A couple of years ago, I was working on a big project, I really poured my heart and soul into it and I got played by my partner. I thought about going to court, and then my mom told me, “Let it go, you don’t need it. Even if you win, it’s going to eat you up and I’m just going to lose you as a daughter.” As an entrepreneur I wanted to fight for it, but in the end I let it go.",business
"HULK HOGAN’S lawsuit against Gawker Media, heard in a Florida courtroom last month, had the surreal quality of, well, a professional wrestling match. Mr. Hogan sued the company after Gawker posted a video clip showing the wrestler having sex with the then-wife of his then-friend, the radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge.The amount of damages awarded to Mr. Hogan in the trial — a total of $140 million — implies that the excesses of digital media might be causing a backlash. (Gawker has said that it will appeal.) While the balance between privacy and press freedom is typically tipped to the latter in the United States, Amy Gajda, a law professor and author of “The First Amendment Bubble,” argued in Slate that recent court cases suggested “that these jurors may not be alone in giving new deference to privacy concerns.”What we really need are more nuanced laws that can safeguard privacy in the digital age. Courts in the United States have held that public figures are less entitled to privacy than the rest of us. But the Hogan case became less about who’s a public figure and more about the ways in which the Internet has allowed our private information to be made public in ways we didn’t intend. For all its absurdity, the fight over Hulk Hogan’s sex tape became a fun-house mirror reflection of the issues that affect all of us.Gawker defended the news value of the video, claiming that Mr. Hogan had lost his right to privacy because he was a celebrity and had already boasted for years about his sex life “on talk radio and shows like Howard Stern,” Nick Denton, Gawker’s founder, wrote on the company’s website after the verdict. Mr. Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, countered that there was a firm line between the man and the alter ego he plays.",business
"Around 2011, WWE started thinking about starting its own HBO-style cable channel, according to George Barrios, the company’s chief strategy and financial officer. (Barrios went to WWE from The New York Times Company, where he was the treasurer.) But by 2013, WWE executives had done research showing that wrestling fans — most of whom are not wealthy — were big users of broadband, watching shows from streaming services like Netflix and Hulu considerably more often than most people. They were also voracious watchers of YouTube. (Barrios said the WWE gets more YouTube views for its short-form content, such as highlights, than any other sports channel.) So the company decided to abandon the cable channel idea and develop a streaming service instead.“We thought if this is where our consumers are going, we needed to be there as well,” Barrios said. Streaming has undeniable advantages over traditional television. The subscribers belong to WWE, not to a cable company, so it can market to them more directly. It can sell WWE clothing and paraphernalia directly from its app. The WWE Network allows it to make money on its popular archives. And it gets steady, monthly checks from its subscribers, rather than having to count on less-reliable pay-per-view revenue.“They thought they needed one million subscribers to make it work,” said Brandon Ross, an analyst who covers the stock for BTIG, an investment firm. “For them, it was a no-brainer.” The WWE Network hit the million mark in 2015. WWE still offers its premium events on pay per view — so as not to lose fans who don’t yet have broadband — but that income stream is declining as more wrestling fans turn to the WWE Network.What you won’t find on the WWE Network is either “Raw” or “Smackdown,” which remain on USA. But that doesn’t mean that USA executives aren’t nervous. In May 2014, a few months after the launch of its new streaming service, WWE signed a new rights deal with the cable network that was considerably lower than expected. Clearly, the lower amount was a result of USA’s fears that streaming would cut into its ratings. Wall Street panicked, and WWE’s stock dropped almost 50 percent in a day. Though the stock eventually recovered, McMahon lost his billionaire status for a while.Today, “Raw” and “Smackdown” have a combined viewership of well over 10 million. That’s still a lot higher than the WWE Network’s 1.82 million subscribers. And WWE’s television rights remain its largest single source of revenue. But the ratings for “Raw” are down somewhat — as are the ratings for the entire USA Network — and if the WWE Network continues to gain subscribers at the pace it is on, it’s worth wondering how long WWE will remain committed to a cable network whose profits are dependent on an eroding business model.If I were an executive at CBS, NBC, Fox or ESPN, I would be nervous, too. The N.F.L.-Twitter deal might not look like much in financial terms, but it offers the N.F.L. a cheap and easy chance to experiment with putting football games online in a way that is untethered to a television network or a cable or satellite subscription. Over time, that can’t possibly lead anyplace good for the networks.",business
"He was convicted of five counts of wire fraud at trial and sentenced to 18 months in prison. But the appeals court concluded there was not enough evidence to show any fraud despite his not telling the truth to either side, taking the rare step of ordering that Mr. Weimert be acquitted of the charges.The appeals court focused on the fact that there were ongoing negotiations between the bank and the buyers, so that “it is not unusual for parties to conceal from others their true goals, values, priorities, or reserve prices in a proposed transaction.” In other words, no one tells the truth when they are negotiating a deal.Indeed, the opinion went even further in analyzing what can amount to a fraud during negotiations.“To state the obvious, they will often try to mislead the other party about the prices and terms they are willing to accept. Such deceptions are not criminal,” the court found.To violate the wire fraud statute, any deception must be “material,” which means a reasonable person would consider it important in the transaction. Statements like “this is my final offer” or “I can’t go any lower than this” are not something on which the other side is likely to rely. The appeals court asserted that “negotiating parties, and certainly the sophisticated businessmen in this case, do not expect complete candor about negotiating positions.”Can it really be that lies are acceptable in a negotiation? No less than Professor James J. White, a renowned commercial law scholar, once wrote that “to conceal one’s true position, to mislead an opponent about one’s true settling point, is the essence of negotiation.” You cannot lie about whether you will pay the amount promised, or mislead about the condition of property, but telling the truth about what it will take to get the deal done appears to be acceptable.",business
"LONDON — Philips, the Dutch electronics giant, said on Monday that it was “more likely” that the company would pursue an initial public offering, rather than a private sale, of its lighting business.Philips first announced plans in 2014 to spin off the lighting business as part of a reshaping of the company to focus on health care and technology. Since then, the company has pursued a dual-track effort to separate the lighting division through either a public offering or a private sale.As part of its first-quarter results on Monday, Philips said that improving markets had increased the possibility of its pursuing a public listing for the business.“With equity markets’ sentiment improving compared to the first couple of months of the year, an I.P.O. increasingly appears a more likely outcome, subject to further market developments and other relevant circumstances,” Philips said in a news release. “However, the company has not yet concluded on all proposals in the private sale process and continues to assess the attractiveness of this route compared to the I.P.O.”",business

"To the Editor:Mr. Obama has said that Britain must stay in the European Union to have influence on the world stage, and on his current visit here has already encouraged Britain’s voters to stay in the European Union. Perhaps it has not occurred to him that this is equivalent to King George III and his ministers in the 18th century advising Britain’s American colonists that they must stay in the British Empire to have any influence in the world.The reality is that Britain has negligible influence in the European Union although being the second largest net contributor to it. We have under 10 percent of the total votes in the European Parliament and are constantly outvoted while also having only one European commissioner out of 28. At least 50 percent of our laws and regulations that override the laws of our own Parliament are made by some 25,000 European civil servants in Brussels. Their declared intention is to create a fully federal and centralized Europe, and the next step is to make every E.U. country’s finance minister submit his or her government’s budget to an E.U. financial controller for approval, thus removing the main remaining vestige of national sovereignty from the member states.Would the United States submit to such conditions?

"It is now a standard feature of the typical Hollywood blockbuster. You watch scenes that have become more complex and dazzling than ever in their visual effects and technical mastery, then sit through end credits that feel almost novelistic in length: hundreds, or frequently thousands, of names in a blur of acknowledgment of the village it took to stage a superhero battle or bring robots to photorealistic life.The names can occupy five to 10 minutes or more of a movie’s running time. And we’re often staying put so as not to miss a possible extra scene or a tease to other films in a franchise. In the meantime, we learn about film jobs we had no idea existed. (Hello, render wrangler!) And yet many names are still missing, and some in the industry don’t think the credits are long enough.How did we get here?It used to be much simpler. The earliest films, shown at nickelodeons at the start of the 1900s, had no credits at all, just the title.“But then eventually people started to recognize stars that they liked,” said Dave Kehr, a curator for the department of film at the Museum of Modern Art. He mentioned the emergence of the silent-era actress Florence Lawrence, who wasn’t credited in her earliest films but built a fan following to the point that her name eventually appeared on a movie poster, making her one of the very first movie stars.",movies
"The reputation of the French director Jean-Pierre Melville may rest on his laconic films noirs, but the heart of his oeuvre is his treatment of occupied France — in “The Silence of the Sea” (1949), “Army of Shadows” (1969) and, revived this week in a new digital restoration, “Léon Morin, Priest” (1961).Cinephiles revered Melville, and Nouvelle Vague filmmakers saw him as a precursor, but he once told an interviewer that he was tired of being “known only to a handful of crazy film buffs.” “Léon Morin, Priest” was his corrective: Adapted from a prizewinning novel by Béatrix Beck and featuring a pair of hot young actors, Emmanuelle Riva and Jean-Paul Belmondo, “Morin” was more commercially successful at the time than any of his previous movies.Ms. Riva’s role, that of a young widow named Barny living in a German-occupied village in eastern France, recalls her character in Alain Resnais’s “Hiroshima Mon Amour” (1959), a Frenchwoman haunted by a wartime love affair with a German soldier. Mr. Belmondo, made famous as an arrogant criminal in Jean-Luc Godard’s “Breathless” (1960), was cast against type in the title role. Even after five decades, his entrance in priestly vestments remains startling.Barny, the widow of a Communist Jew, is initially hostile to Father Morin. Going to confession as a joke, she baits him by comparing religion to opium. She is taken aback when Morin agrees and proposes to start a dialogue. She is further taken aback by his forthright demeanor, which she describes in voice-over as “the style and manner of a militant.” Their verbal sparring powers the movie. With its lengthy, erotically charged discussions (drawn largely verbatim from the novel), “Morin” is a theological action film that anticipates Eric Rohmer’s romantic talkathon, “My Night at Maude’s,” a philosophical debate between a chaste man and an attractive, experienced woman. The stakes, however, are much higher.",movies
"Devoted to an actor of uncommon looks, charm and range, the Marcello Mastroianni retrospective at the Film Society of Lincoln Center includes a work that is itself rare: Luchino Visconti’s adaptation of Albert Camus’s novel “The Stranger.”The movie, in which an ordinary Pied-Noir (Algerian-born Frenchman) irrationally murders an Arab in broad daylight on a Mediterranean beach, was made in 1967 with Mastroianni in the lead. It has long been without an American distributor and, owing to complicated rights issues, was never released here on DVD. It’s showing on Saturday and Tuesday in an excellent 35-millimeter print from the Istituto Luce Cinecittà.Shot in Technicolor entirely in Algeria, with Jean-Luc Godard’s favored actress, Anna Karina, as the protagonist’s lover, Visconti’s “The Stranger” makes the senseless sensuous — even sybaritic — in its blazing light and palpable heat. The movie was eagerly anticipated but suspiciously received when it opened in New York in December 1967. Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice deemed it a cynical producer’s package intended to titillate “urban art-house, God-is-dead-and-living-in-Argentina sophisticates.”Visconti seemed an inappropriate choice to direct Camus’s laconic classic. He was an operatic stylist and an aristocratic Marxist then best known in the United States for his neorealist and costume spectacles “Rocco and His Brothers” (1961) and “The Leopard” (1963). Mr. Sarris accused him of having “prostrated his own directorial personality before the cultural monumentality of Camus.”",movies
"You can’t go wrong with a retrospective of Ernst Lubitsch, whose movies still sparkle with urbanity and sly wit. Film Forum serves up a feast of them beginning Friday, June 2, in “The Lubitsch Touch,” which commemorates the 125th anniversary of his birth. The program, which runs through June 15, features 31 films, an array that demonstrates versatility and adaptability. Lubitsch, who died in 1947, began directing in the silent era but transitioned with apparent ease into talkies. For a sample of his style, you can’t do better than the 1940 comedy “The Shop Around the Corner” (showing June 3).It stars James Stewart and Margaret Sullavan as shop employees who dislike each other but don’t realize they’ve been corresponding anonymously and flirtatiously. In the land of Lubitsch, jokes are slipped in subtly.“How much is that belt in the window, the one that says $2.95?” a customer asks.“$2.95,” Stewart’s character replies, somewhat baffled.“Oh,” she says disapprovingly. “No.” And she walks out.",movies
"The New Wonder WomanYou might not know the name Gal Gadot right now, but you’ve probably seen her in “The Fast and the Furious” movies.

"MacLeod’s fiction is full of traps — some physical, some psychological, none easy to wriggle free of. His 2016 novel “Stranded” is about a polar expedition stuck in the ice, and many of the strongest stories in “13 Views of the Suicide Woods” are about confinements of various kinds: There’s one called “The Texas Chainsaw Breakfast Club, or I Don’t Like Mondays,” in which a group of high-school kids are taken prisoner by a demented teacher; another (“Reminisce”) whose hero, a homeless veteran, is kidnapped by an apparently ordinary suburban couple; and several more in which characters are maneuvered (or maneuver themselves) into places where their options are, let’s say, severely limited. Sticklers for genre classification might prefer to label the stories in this book something other than “horror” — “dark fiction,” maybe, or noir — but what’s the point of quibbling? Noir, I’ve always thought, is only horror without the metaphors. The affinity may be more evident in the movies than in literature. The visual style of film noir, with its shadowy, high-contrast blacks and whites, is pretty much identical to that of the classic horror movies of the ’20s, ’30s and ’40s; the same director (Jacques Tourneur) and the same cinematographer (Nicholas Musuraca) made “Cat People” and “Out of the Past,” after all. MacLeod’s characters, who are often working-class people with dangerously low expectations of life, remind me of the doomed protagonists of Cornell Woolrich’s novels and stories, those hapless folks for whom everything, elaborately and implacably, sooner or later goes wrong. Sounds like horror to me.ImageIf there’s anything that has changed significantly in the horror landscape of the past 30 or 40 years, it’s the increased fluidity of the genre’s conventions and its readers’ expectations. Monsters are no longer required, unnatural creatures like vampires and werewolves and even zombies are no longer necessarily the villains, and “horror” now seems less a literary (or cinematic) form than an attitude, like rock ’n’ roll — which has, at least since the punk revolution of the 1970s, embraced the genre warmly. Josh Malerman, the author of the delirious new novel BLACK MAD WHEEL (Ecco, $26.99), is relatively new to horror fiction — his first book, “Bird Box,” was published three years ago — but he’s a rock veteran: He has been the lead singer of the Detroit band the High Strung for over 20 years. Philip Tonka, the hero of “Black Mad Wheel,” is the piano player of a Motor City rock ’n’ roll outfit called the Danes, who as the novel begins are a dozen years past the end of their service in World War II and enjoying the freedom, money and fame their music has brought them. Into their idyllic little world, a studio they call Wonderland, one day comes a high-ranking military official who wants them to listen to a tape recording of a mysterious sound. He wants them, for a price, to help the Army locate and identify it; this sound, it seems, has the power to neutralize any kind of weapon, and perhaps to make people disappear. We know it’s bad, because in the book’s first scene Philip wakes from a coma in a hospital bed, months after the expedition, with practically every bone in his body crushed and his bandmates gone; for most of the rest of the story he tries to remember what happened, and to figure out what the military has in mind for him now.It’s a good setup for a science-fiction horror novel, and Malerman, alternating past and present, keeps the action galloping along nicely, a long jam with a seductive, infectious rhythm. But in the time-honored traditions of both horror and rock, things get wilder and stranger as the big finish approaches: Malerman’s story takes flight in some head-splitting metaphysical directions. It’s as if he were veering off into a search for cosmic harmonies, the very music of the spheres, and although I couldn’t quite hear it myself, I enjoyed listening to his frantic improvisations. His crash-and-burn attitude can be a useful aesthetic for musicians, and for writers. It’s only rock ’n’ roll — or horror — but I like it.ImageThere’s something of that reckless abandon, too, in Giorgio De Maria’s startling THE TWENTY DAYS OF TURIN (Liveright, $24.95), a novel that would place its author in the vanguard of the new horror were it not for the inconvenient fact that he wrote it 40 years ago. (And the melancholy fact that he died in 2009.) Now that it has been translated into English for the first time — serviceably, by Ramon Glazov — it could, I suppose, take its place as a freshly exhumed classic from the period Laird Barron cites as the genre’s heyday, except that it doesn’t much resemble the horror fiction of that King-dominated time. Or, for that matter, any other. The novel is subtitled “A Report From the End of the Century” and is narrated by an unnamed man who is trying to write an account of some disturbing events of a decade earlier, which may or may not have been “a phenomenon of collective psychosis.” For three weeks, it seems, large numbers of ordinary citizens of Turin began to suffer from insomnia and to wander, mute, through the streets of the nocturnal city, where some met grisly ends. Unearthly sounds (like “a terrible war cry” ), a few remember, accompanied the macabre doings; the surviving witnesses can’t explain what they saw or heard. During this same nightmarish time, a new civic institution suddenly came into being, a library of anonymous personal diaries made available for perusal at the St. Cottolengo Little House of Divine Providence. The connections among these disparate spooky manifestations, all of which ended as suddenly and as inexplicably as they began, are what the narrator is attempting to discover, at least until it dawns on him that his investigation might be putting him, and his city, in danger. He senses he’s being followed; he’s receiving peculiar unsigned letters, to which he is expected to respond; and from time to time a nun, Sister Clotilde, pops up to issue a cryptic warning. He considers leaving the city.",movies

"Summer is fast approaching, and so too is a cavalcade of creeping, slithering, stomping monsters. The nifty independent “Colossal,” which features a Godzilla-like creature terrorizing Seoul, South Korea, is still in theaters. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2” and its science-fiction bestiary opened on Friday, May 5. The latest “Alien” movie is drooling in the wings, and “The Mummy” lands in June. The next “Planet of the Apes” flick arrives in July, and while that franchise may not feature traditional fiends, it finds the monstrous in a familiar place: human beings. Our chief film critics, Manohla Dargis and A. O. Scott, discuss monsters and wonder how they could be any more frightening than real life.MANOHLA DARGIS Gee, Tom Cruise looks kind of grim in the trailers for “The Mummy,” the first entry in Universal’s shared monster world — not to be confused with Warner Bros. and Legendary’s MonsterVerse. Mr. Cruise tends not to go light and funny, alas, and this trailer suggests that he will not be camping it up here, probably because there’s too much money at stake. Universal is exhuming a batch of its classic monsters — the Invisible Man, the Wolf Man and Frankenstein’s creature — and synergistically bringing them together.This year’s battle of the creatures started in March with “Kong: Skull Island,” the second in Warner/Legendary’s MonsterVerse, following the disinterment of Godzilla back in 2014. There are all sorts of reasons that we love our monsters — they’re mirrors of our fears and fantasies, to begin with — but one of the biggest reasons the creatures are being unleashed is that the major studios are looking for a way to entice audiences. That’s crucial given that Disney is so dominant now and owns not only Pixar, a brand that feels like an integrated world unto itself, but also the “Star Wars” franchise and Marvel, each with a shared fictional universe that seems to allow for endless permutations.",movies
"It’s summer, even if it doesn’t feel like it yet in New York. To get ourselves in the warm-weather spirit, we went to see “Baywatch,” the new big-screen reboot of the 1990s TV series, starring Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron as crime-solving lifeguards. We expected just to gawk at the hard bodies and giggle at the corny jokes — and we did that — but we were surprised that the film had a harder edge. It treated the beach like a prison yard, a place to be patrolled and policed, not for fun and frolicking. It left us thinking about the allocation of public spaces and how our own personal histories are tied up in how we experience the beach.First, we talk about the American cultural perception of the beach through movies. There is a rich American history of movies, like “Gidget,” “Terms of Endearment” and even “Blue Crush,” that portray the beach as a portal to another dimension, a place where dreams and desires can roam free. The beach is a vacation from reality, a place where anything is possible — romance and magic. That’s how Jenna sees it, at least. She talks about the beach as the ultimate escape from city life and a safe place for exploration and pleasure. It’s a little more complicated for Wesley. We try to understand why that is, and untangling the answer brings us to the history of wade-ins and how beaches still bear the traces of the era of segregation and racial exclusion.We discuss the beach in all its incarnations: as a physical place and a psychic destination. Has the carefree beach of “Gidget” been definitively replaced by a more sinister vision? Is there a link between the fading dream of the beach and the regulation of public spaces in our country?How do I listen? Two ways",movies
"Few movies are as redolent of their times as “Funeral Parade of Roses,” a 1969 exemplar of Japanese countercultural ferment that, retrieved from history’s dustbin and digitally restored to its original black-and-white glory, opens on Friday at the Quad.It was the first feature by the mixed-media artist Toshio Matsumoto (1932-2017), a polemical figure who in 1958 published a manifesto calling for a new cinematic form merging documentary and experimental films.“Funeral Parade” is that. A hodgepodge of themes and techniques, it transposes the Oedipus story to the intersection of Tokyo’s hippie and “gay boy” subcultures, opening with a Baudelaire quotation and incorporating street rituals by the Zero Jigen performance group. The title, taken from one performance, is a pun: Bara, Japanese for “rose,” is a slang term akin to the English “pansy.”The protagonist, Eddie (played by the androgynous entertainer Peter, later featured in Akira Kurosawa’s 1985 “Ran”), is a sweet hustler with a dark past. As polished a looker as the Warhol Factory’s reigning drag queens Candy Darling and Holly Woodlawn, Eddie parlays an affair with a local drug dealer into becoming the madam of the Club Genet, an actual gay bar in the Shinjuku district of Tokyo. The movie, however, is a lot less linear than Eddie’s rise.",movies
"There’s a refined simplicity to the home page of Filmatique, a web-streaming service, that nicely underscores its mission. The site, which offers subscriptions for $4.95 a month and is also available on Apple TV, has a relatively small selection at the moment (about 40 films). But its browsing page, where the international titles are arrayed in short rows, with still images and short descriptions set against a plain black background, features impressive mini-collections of recent movies that have been hard to see in the United States. Many of them are barely known here, but the presentation makes them appear attractive, intriguing and maybe even (although this category isn’t one that I’m always sold on) important.Ursula Grisham, one of the site’s three founders, said that Filmatique, which started late last year, seeks out movies of “cultural, social and political significance or substance,” though she doesn’t think of the site as being devoted to “issue-driven cinema.”A recent addition to the site, the 2016 film “Where I Grow Old,” the first fictional feature directed by the Brazilian documentarian Marilia Rocha, is an exemplary film for the site. The story is of Francisca, a young woman living in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, and questioning her choices after leaving her home in Portugal in the midst of that country’s recent political upheaval. The movie is a quiet, beguiling character drama — the often hand-held camera gets into the characters’ faces and movements in startlingly intimate ways — with a social backdrop and subtext that give it a particular kind of heft.After President Trump’s first attempt to impose a travel ban, restricting people from several Middle Eastern and African countries from entering the United States, Filmatique arranged, in March, a “Banned Countries” collection. These movies include the documentary “Silvered Water, Syria Self-Portrait” and Iran’s official submission to the 87th Academy Awards, “Today,” directed by Reza Mirkarimi. In that movie, which loosely recalls the Faulkner short story “Tomorrow,” a very taciturn older cabdriver (Parviz Parastui) finds himself looking after a pregnant woman (Soheila Golestani) he picks up on the street. She is on her own, and after a few unanswered mobile phone calls, she realizes, finally, that no one else is going to help her. The driver sticks with her at the hospital despite the assumptions that come along with his presence. It’s an expertly tailored drama with exceptional acting.",movies
"Rapturously received but mysteriously forgotten after its 1964 New York opening, Jacques Becker’s prison drama, “Le Trou” (“The Hole”), returns, digitally restored, for a week at Film Forum.Becker served as Jean Renoir’s assistant throughout the 1930s and was interned for a year by the Germans during the occupation of France. Both experiences inform “Le Trou.” The camaraderie of five prisoners sharing a cell and working together on a tunnel to freedom has something of the Renoir spirit; the movie’s sense of claustrophobia and obsession with prison procedure bespeaks firsthand knowledge.Although carefully staged, “Le Trou” has its documentary aspects: It was adapted from a novel based on an actual event and cast with nonactors, including former prisoners. The ringer, a bourgeois youth thrown together with four hardened proletariat types, is one of the few professionals. (He’s played by Marc Michel, who subsequently appeared in Jacques Demy’s “Lola” and “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.”)Extraordinarily single-minded and intrinsically suspenseful, “Le Trou” is often compared to Robert Bresson’s “A Condemned Man Escaped,” made a few years earlier. Despite similarities in plot, however, there is nothing transcendent about Becker’s gritty film. (Bresson scores his film with Mozart; Becker withholds music until the closing credits.) Still, Becker’s death at 53, shortly before “Le Trou” opened in Paris in 1960, may account for the reverence with which his peers regarded the movie.",movies
"TALKING PICTURESHow to Watch MoviesBy Ann Hornaday289 pp. Basic Books. $26.Consider the following four movie reviews:“Awesome!”“Awful!”“Criminally underrated!”“It is my sad duty to report that I was mildly disappointed!”The first two reactions are probably the analyses of amateur movie lovers, and the latter are more likely the declarations of professional critics, but still: All four are equally valid reactions to a movie-going experience. And all four are equally useless opinions, of no interest — unless that opiner can back up sentiment with sense. Analysis. A cogent explanation of the factors that go into passing personal judgment on a work of cinema. Reasonable minds can differ and all that, but the first requirement of any meaningful movie debate is a demonstration of that reason — beyond “I love Wes Anderson movies!” and “I can’t stand Wes Anderson movies!”ImageIn “Talking Pictures: How to Watch Movies,” Ann Hornaday provides a pleasantly calm, eminently sensible, down-the-middle primer for the movie lover — amateur, professional or Twitter-centric orator — who would like to acquire and sharpen basic viewing skills. An estimable movie critic at The Washington Post and a finalist for the 2008 Pulitzer Prize in criticism, Hornaday explains upfront that she did not grow up, in her words, as “a congenital movie geek”; rather, in a winding journalism career that began at Ms. magazine, she learned her craft on the job. In this way, she says, she is more like her readers than like a film studies major or a gender studies major or a was-Pauline-Kael-really-all-that? major. And, inspired by a series of instructional articles she assembled for her readers some years back, here she considers various aspects of filmmaking in chapters that roughly follow the timeline of production: screenplay, acting, production design, cinematography, editing, sound and music, and directing. (Missing from consideration: a grasp of cinema history and cultural context within which to assess Movie A in relationship to Movies B-Z.)Hornaday fortifies her observations with comments from film professionals — writers, actors, directors — interviewed for the project. She also peppers each chapter with suggested questions a conscientious viewer might want to ask in each category. The screenplay: “Did the movie flow? Did I care what happened next?” The acting: “Did the actors disappear completely into their roles?” The directing: “Did the movie reflect ambition and vision beyond simply recording performances?” Inevitably, as a seasoned critic, she asks questions that reinforce her own aesthetic preferences. And so, especially, does the recommended viewing she lists at the end of each chapter — certified examples of excellence that only the most insistent of contrarians might challenge, including “Casablanca” and “Chinatown” for screenplay, “The Hurt Locker” for directing, and Viola Davis in “Fences” for acting. (The book is current through 2016 and the triumph of “Moonlight.”)",movies
"‘Napoleon Dynamite’ (2004)One of those movies I could watch over and over again, because it was just so out of left field.

"The filmmaker Bill Morrison customarily constructs his movies with footage from other films that are very old and whose prints are very worn. No matter the ostensible subject of his individual pictures, the overarching theme is impermanence; his best-known work, “Decasia” (2002), is an artfully edited assemblage of found footage whose visual appeal is the crumbling of the film emulsion itself. So it’s a bit of a shock that “Dawson City: Frozen Time” begins with a brightly colored, completely intact clip from a television show about baseball in which Mr. Morrison appears, talking to an enthusiastic host about newly discovered footage related to the Black Sox baseball-betting scandal of 1919.Mr. Morrison’s film tells the story of how that footage, and several hundred other reels of volatile nitrate film from the 1910s and ’20s, were discovered decades after they were presumed to be permanently lost. But part of the point of “Dawson City” is that the film prints had actually been forgotten — buried underground in an era when not much thought was given to their artistic or historical value. The discovery was made in 1978 in Dawson, also known as Dawson City, a Yukon River town in northwestern Canada. A local man who was clearing a lot with a backhoe suddenly found himself digging up film reels, and he paused. The story of the finding unfolds via television news clips from the late 1970s; then Mr. Morrison goes further back, using a wide variety of much older footage.“Dawson City” tells a number of stories: about how the addition of certain chemicals to cotton created an explosive (nicknamed gun cotton) that was developed into celluloid motion picture film; about a settlement of Native Americans that was muscled out of existence by white settlers trekking north during the gold rushes of the mid- and late-19th centuries; about the boom and bust cycles of Dawson City itself, which burned to the ground once a year for the first nine years of its existence.It tells the stories of famous fortunes made in this vicinity, including that of one Frederick Trump, the president’s grandfather. Future pioneers of Hollywood, such as the actor-director William Desmond Taylor and the theater entrepreneurs Alexander Pantages and Sid Grauman, somehow got their starts in this remote locale. As silent motion pictures became a worldwide attraction, Dawson City became the end of the line for film distribution routes. And after a given picture’s run, individual distributors balked at paying for return shipment. The town inadvertently came to house a huge film library, which was eventually sent floating down the Yukon. Except, that is, for a portion that was buried, for an unusual and arguably hilarious reason.",movies
"Over in the serious part of this newspaper, my colleagues A.O. Scott and Manohla Dargis have a list of the twenty-five best motion pictures of the new millennium. It’s the sort of exercise that’s intended to conjure up controversy and alternate lists, and what with my sideline in movie reviews I’m not going to resist the temptation. Especially since my colleagues are, of course, terribly wrong in many of their picks.Wrong … but also somewhat more cinematically literate, since their list includes more than a couple of movies (intellectual vanity precludes me from admitting how many) that I haven’t even seen. With that in mind, consider this counter-list as a more America-first exercise, tilted slightly more toward commercial films, and reflecting the somewhat narrower and less international ambit of my own filmgoing since the year 2000.*“Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind/”The Forty-Year-Old Virgin”/”Mad Max: Fury Road”These are the three choices on my colleagues’ list that I’ll happily endorse: The most complete and accessible and moving Charlie Kaufman movie, the peak of the Apatowian marriage of gross-out sex-comedy and social conservatism, and the only aesthetically de novo action blockbuster of our superhero-ridden age.“Mulholland Drive”Cinematic greatness often lies in the place where a difficult artist’s tendency toward inscrutability and self-indulgence goes so far … but no further. That’s “Mulholland Drive” for David Lynch — a movie drenched in Lynchian weirdness and horror and misdirection that’s nonetheless strikingly transparent in its overall arc (and therefore more affecting/horrifying) once you figure out what’s supposed to be going on.“The New World”This is not the most critically-beloved of Terence Malick’s return-to-filmmaking oeuvre, but to me it has the same quality as “Mulholland” does for Lynch — a feeling of being successfully tethered to a clear-enough (and, helpfully, famous) story, which prevents the filmmaker’s longueurs and murmurs and fragmented style from taking over too completely. (Don’t ask me about the last few Malick movies.) “Tree of Life” is close but not as perfect. Matt Zoller Seitz has written about a million words in praise of “The New World”; some of them are here. The final scene is a peak-within-a-peak.“Pan’s Labyrinth”Guillermo Del Toro is a genius hampered by his own slightly-too-fanboyish taste and Hollywood’s inability to figure out how to use him. But “Pan’s Labyrinth” is a work of left-wing historical horror-fantasy perfection, a dark fairy tale with a child’s-eye perspective that precisely balances the monstrous and the luminous.“Moulin Rouge!”Sorry not sorry: Baz Luhrmann’s riotous musical-melodrama pastiche is joyful and glorious and the movie meant a lot to me when I was exactly the right age for it. Which is what an over-the-top cinematic love story should offer to the world: Foolish inspiration for the young.“The Squid and the Whale”Again, a case where a difficult director hit his sweet spot. With their interest in unpleasant people Noah Baumbach’s movies can be one long cringe for the viewer, but here things never get too claustrophobic or airless and the result is pitch-perfect Gen X-on-Boomer violence. Peak Jeff Daniels, near-peak Jessie Eisenberg, plus an excellent Laura Linney. Maybe the best divorce-revolution movie, eclipsing “Kramer vs. Kramer.”“The Social Network”Actual peak Eisenberg and peak David Fincher as well; I know critical opinion prefers “Zodiac” but I give this one extra points for social relevance. Yes, it’s not really an accurate portrait of Mark Zuckerberg the human being, but it’s a dead-on portrait of the sociology and psychology of meritocracy and it’s a case where Aaron Sorkin’s sometimes tiresome old male liberal’s anti-millennial bias produced a screenplay that gives social media exactly the cold-eyed treatment it deserves.“The 25th Hour”The best Spike Lee movie and the best 9/11 movie and the best New York movie of the last fifteen years. The competition on all three fronts is sadly weak but I’m not damning with faint praise; this is a great film.“Ida” / “Of Gods and Men” / (“Calvary”)Only the first two are actually make my top twenty-five, but I included the slightly-inferior (because stagier) “Calvary” because the three movies together offer a marvelous triptych of meditations on the nature of religious vocation and the place of Catholic Christianity in the late modern world.“The Passion of the Christ”/”Apocalypto”Now I’m definitely cheating by including these as a package, because neither is quite great enough to make the list by itself. But no mainstream American filmmaker has done anything quite as daring and distinctive as this dead-language double feature, and Mel Gibson’s demons and violence and anti-Semitism — plus Bush-era culture warring in the case of “The Passion” — have prevented him from earning the full critical recognition that his strange experiments deserve. (As an alternative double feature, a window into the problem of suffering and the divided modern Catholic mind, I recommend pairing “The Passion” and Martin Scorsese’s near-great “Silence”)“The Lives of Others”I don’t think much needs to be said in defense of this choice. A study of the soul of man under an ossified, bureaucratic utopianism, a triumph of reserved acting and controlled filmmaking craft, and in every way the movie that late Communism deserved.“No Country For Old Men”This is the safe and boring Coen brothers choice, the most widely-appreciated of a rich but polarizing set of options. A resistance to safety and boredom inspired Scott and Dargis to pick “Inside Llewyn Davis” instead, and a similar impulse prods me toward the brothers’ Jewish and Catholic movies, “A Serious Man” and “Hail, Caesar!” … but in the end, the dark Calvinist (but not nihilist) “No Country” has a consensus behind it for a reason. Better safe than wrong.“The Royal Tenenbaums”This one I’m really not sure about. Again, I’m going with consensus, but part of me thinks that “Grand Budapest Hotel” is actually the best Wes Anderson, and part of me even thinks that no, actually, it’s the underrated “Moonrise Kingdom.” (I’m sure it’s not “Darjeeling Express.”) Ask me again in ten years.“The Queen of Versailles”As with foreign films I see fewer documentaries than I should but this one strikes me as a definitive sort of American story for our time — a tale of hubris, class, and real estate, the pursuit of celebrity and beauty, the Gatsbyan dream in its crasser, coarser form. A film about the housing bubble, but also a film for the age of Trump.“Arrival”I’m not sure how this one will age, and it relies on a narrative trick to leave you wrecked at the end — but what a trick it is, in a movie anchored by a flawless Amy Adams performance and shot through with real sci-fi wonder of the old school. The Atlantic’s Chris Orr is its chief apologist; read him.“Inglorious Basterds”Certainly the best Tarantino movie of the millennium; indeed probably the only good one. It has some of the usual Tarantino flaws and the scenes with the titular Basterds have a B-movie bloodthirstiness that’s QT at his most adolescent and therefore lame. But overall the set-pieces, the performances and the atmosphere are all phenomenal. Tarantino’s gonzo reimagined World War II makes the reimagined World War I of “Wonder Woman” look limp and, well, comic-bookish by comparison.“Lord of the Rings”The third installment has big problems but it’s still a miracle that that the trilogy as a whole is such a triumph, especially since we now have “The Hobbit” movies to show us how easily and awfully it could all have gone completely wrong. Peaks: Everything with the Rohirrim, especially Miranda Otto, the Battle of Helm’s Deep, and Sean Bean’s Boromir, especially his death. The extended versions are better, even for the bloated third (sometimes more feels like less). A good little scene in the weakest movie is here.“Grizzly Man”A perfect marriage of found footage and framing, of subject and filmmaker. Werner Herzog’s best late film, a Teutonic pessimist’s meditation on the most American of happy pantheists and his griz — er, grisly fate, and a movie whose star’s existentialist solo act eclipses all his recent fictional competitors, from Damon in “The Martian” to Redford in “All Is Lost.” But don’t see it on a full stomach.“Eastern Promises”The David Cronenberg film that tends to show up on these lists is “A History of Violence” but that one always felt a little pat and by-the-numbers to me. The other Viggo Mortensen-Cronenberg collaboration, on the other hand, has an enveloping Old World darkness that lingers, a style at once sumptuous and sinister, and a distinctive vision of the modern immigrant city as a noisome and twisty sort of purgatory. Pairs well with Stephen Frears’ also-excellent “Dirty Pretty Things,” a slightly more optimistic take on the hidden paths of multicultural London.“The Incredibles”The most complete and flawless of the major Pixar movies, if not always the most ambitious. (The first act of “Wall-E” and the opening of “Up” reach higher but as whole films they aren’t as good.) Also one of the best superhero movies amid our present glut. Also one of the great Holly Hunter performances. A trifecta.“Gladiator”***A movie, like “Braveheart” before it, that has lots of snobbish detractors. They’re wrong: It’s the only fully successful historical epic of our era, with a Russell Crowe performance that richly deserved the Oscar and a Joaquin Phoenix performance that was even better, in that gonzo Phoenix way. Ridley Scott almost never has the solid scripts he needs; this time he did. And if you differ with my assessment, all I have to say to you is this.Some (random) honorable mentions:“Bridesmaids” for comedy, “28 Days Later” for zombie apocalypse, “There Will Be Blood” for near-masterpieces horribly damaged by their endings, “The Devil Wears Prada” for great feminist popcorn movies horribly damaged by their endings, “Edge of Tomorrow” for Tom Cruise movies, “Catch Me If You Can” for both Spielberg and DiCaprio movies, “The Dark Knight Rises” for Batman movies, “Memento” for non-Batman Christopher Nolan movies, “Brick” for noir and high school melodrama both, “Planet of the Apes” for franchise reboots, “Brooklyn” and “Sing Street” for movies about the Irish before and after the cultural revolution, “Brokeback Mountain” for good movies robbed of their Best Picture by terrible ones, “Miami Vice” for Michael Mann movies, and the original “Pirates of the Caribbean” for blockbusters absolutely ruined by their sequels.***Update: It has been brought to my attention that “Gladiator” (as well as “Memento,” one of my honorable mentions) came out in the Year of Our Lord 2000, not 2001 as I’d mistakenly thought, and thus is technically ineligible for a best of the 21st century list. So Gladiahaters, rejoice, it’s disqualified. But rather than fill its place, I’ll just mention a few movies that I missed in my hasty sweep through the internet and my own memory. First, Apatow’s criminally-underrated “Funny People,” which if I hadn’t been trying to find common ground with my colleagues probably would have been a better choice than “40-Year-Old Virgin” for my list — not least for its brilliant (no joke) Adam Sandler performance, better than his much-praised foray into serious in “Punch-Drunk Love.” Second, “Fill the Void,” an Israeli film about complicated marriage arrangements among the Orthodox, and a powerful Jewish companion to the Catholic movies I highlighted above. Finally, “In Bruges, scripted and directed by the Irish playwright brother of the Irish writer-director of “Calvary,” which pairs well with either that sin-haunted film or with “Eastern Promises,” depending on whether you’re looking for hints of the divine or just a sojourn in the underworld.",movies
"HE’S GOT RHYTHMThe Life and Career of Gene KellyBy Cynthia Brideson and Sara BridesonIllustrated. 517 pp. University Press of Kentucky. $39.95.One of Gene Kelly’s co-stars, the swimmer Esther Williams, left for posterity a succinct version of his life story: He was “a jerk, but he could dance!” Cynthia Brideson and Sara Brideson’s “He’s Got Rhythm,” the first substantial biography of Kelly since his death in 1996, provides the details Williams left out, but essentially says the same thing. The book retells the accepted view of Kelly’s scandal-free life. He was a happily married man (that is, happily married until his divorce from his first wife, Betsy Blair, then happily married to his second, Jeanne Coyne, until her death, and then happily married to his third, Patricia Ward, until his own death). He was a devoted father to his three children (one with Blair, two with Coyne), a wonderful host to a world of friends at lively parties he gave in the house that was his home for 50 years, and, although a demanding taskmaster who could make Cyd Charisse cry, a heck of a swell guy who was tough only because of his incredible dedication to his profession.Is there no more? Was Gene Kelly, as he asks about Leslie Caron in “An American in Paris” (1951), the “still water that doesn’t run deep”? The Brideson sisters offer little analysis of what they refer to as his “complexity,” but they do raise significant issues. They admit “Gene pushed people to their limit.” They quote friends who testify to Kelly’s rages whenever he lost a game of any sort. (The composer André Previn, once a member of Kelly’s elite circle of Hollywood intellectuals, stopped attending his parties because of the host’s “desperate need to be the best.”) Betsy Blair Kelly mentions his “lack of deep friendships” (in the authors’ words), and Kelly himself is quoted as saying: “Show business is all I know. Take it away from me and you’ve taken everything.” The book never addresses in depth the inner life of the man who said that, nor does it explain what generated his towering rages (other than a volleyball).ImageThe Brideson sisters — the authors of “Ziegfeld and His Follies” (Sara died earlier this year) — do cover Kelly’s professional story in full detail. Eugene Curran Kelly was born in 1912, the third of five children in a Pittsburgh family. When he left for New York in 1938 at age 26, he was a college graduate, an experienced dancer and a co-owner of successful dance schools. Within three years, he made theater history, as the original Harry the Hoofer in “The Time of Your Life” (1939), the star of the groundbreaking musical “Pal Joey” (1940) and the dance director for the hit show “Best Foot Forward” (1941). He proved himself as actor, musical performer and choreographer — the tripartite basis of his lifetime success. It was inevitable that Hollywood would seek him out.",movies

"Simply described, “Le Gai Savoir” is a series of conversations between two young militants, Émile Rousseau and Patricia Lumumba, played by Jean-Pierre Léaud and Juliet Berto, both veterans of “La Chinoise.” Their dialogues — held in a pool of light on a darkened soundstage — are annotated by rapid-fire montages of news photos, comic strips, print ads and Paris streets, along with Mr. Godard’s urgent whispers.Just as “Émile” was taken as a blueprint for reforming public education during the French Revolution (Rousseau introduced it as a “collection of scattered thoughts and observations” with “little order or continuity”), so “Le Gai Savoir” presents itself as a course of study in the making of political film. First, however, the nature of recorded truth must be determined. Then, a means must be found to get beyond the “enemy” — language.Heady stuff. Mr. Godard occasionally cites Rousseau, along with contemporary philosophers like Jacques Derrida, but as a thinker he has a greater affinity for Lewis Carroll. “Le Gai Savoir” would be hectoring if it were not so playful. (One sequence is a bit of Etch A Sketch scribble-scrabble accompanied by fragmented Mozart.) It is also movie mad. Émile Rousseau announces a plan to bomb Italian theaters because they show dubbed films — an example of “slave sound.”Mr. Godard is as much pop artist as Marxist pamphleteer. A clip meant to show a realized political film has Ms. Berto in 18th-century costume declaiming garbled poetry before a mural of Batman, Spider-Man and the Hulk. “Le Gai Savoir” is also wildly self-reflexive. The actors regularly address the audience. “Half the shots are missing,” Ms. Berto says, to which Mr. Léaud optimistically replies that they will be furnished by those filmmakers Mr. Godard recognized as peers — Jean-Marie Straub, Glauber Rocha and Bernardo Bertolucci.Impenetrable and seductive, “Le Gai Savoir” is a paradox. Vincent Canby, who reviewed it for The New York Times, found it “almost unbearably dense” yet “visually lucid.” The movie is shamelessly beautiful — not least in its lighting. The critic Richard Roud called the photography of Ms. Berto and Mr. Léaud worthy of “a shampoo commercial, so lustrously does it render their hair.”",movies
"“It’s Great to Be Alive” may not be the nuttiest Hollywood musical of 1933 — a year that brought the Marx Brothers’ “Duck Soup” — but it’s surely the only one to end with a production number in which the women of Cuba, the Netherlands and Czechoslovakia compete for the affections of the last man on earth.Restored by the Museum of Modern Art, where it screens this week, “It’s Great to Be Alive” posits a plague called masculitis, which has decimated the world’s male population. The sole survivor is Carlos, a cheerful ladies’ man (the Brazilian actor Raul Roulien) who has dodged the disease thanks to his jealous fiancée (Gloria Stuart). After being dumped, Carlos — who is a pilot as well as a polo player — sets off on a trans-Pacific solo flight, is forced to land on an uninhabited island and disappears for five years.Carlos’s re-emergence into a manless world sets off an international furor. He is abducted by a group of female gangsters led by a cigar-smoking Dorothy Burgess (who had just been seen competing with Jean Harlow for the affections of Clark Gable in “Hold Your Man”). Her gang puts Carlos up for auction only to be raided by the police, who claim him as “government property.” He is given a ticker-tape parade, during which he sings the movie’s title song, but he is not yet free to marry.Slow to start, “It’s Great to Be Alive” profits from the presence of the acerbic character actress Edna May Oliver, in a role that requires her to be variously the world’s greatest scientist (at one point introducing a short-lived “synthetic man”) and the diplomat presiding over a world congress to decide Carlos’s fate.",movies
"Tobacco is appearing more in blockbuster movies, raising public health concerns, a new study finds.Depictions or suggestions of tobacco use in top-grossing movies rose 72 percent from 2010 to 2016, according to the report, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The increase was especially large among top-grossing movies with R ratings, which saw a 90 percent rise in tobacco-use imagery, though researchers noted with special concern that movies rated PG-13 also saw a sizable increase: 43 percent.That, they said, is troubling because evidence strongly suggests that depictions of smoking in movies can lead to youth smoking. To mitigate that, the Motion Picture Association of America should consider giving an R rating to any movie that depicts smoking, they said.“There is an enormous need to implement an industrywide standard by requiring that all movies rated for kids are smoke-free,” Dr. Stanton Glantz, one of the report’s authors, said in a news release. Dr. Glantz is a professor and director of the University of California, San Francisco, Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education. He and two of the four other authors have received grants from the Truth Initiative, an antismoking group.Despite the rise in depictions of tobacco use in movies, cigarette smoking among teenagers is nonetheless declining thanks to robust public health efforts.",movies

His body of work, rich and varied as it is, reveals a man with infinite empathy and intellectual curiosity. Here is a small sample of his works and appearances:""Days Of Heaven"" trailer‘Days of Heaven’Where to watch: FilmStruck, Amazon, iTunes, VuduSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeShepard technically plays the antagonist in this, his first major big-screen role, but his character isn’t exactly a villain. In this swooning Great Plains romance from Terence Malick, Shepard plays a moneyed farmer who employs two smitten drifters, Abby and Bill (Brooke Adams and Richard Gere), only to wind up marrying the enchanting Abby while she carries on with her one true love. Shepard’s transition from a weak and sickly sap into a stung, vengeful cuckold is a perfect vehicle for Malick’s fixation on primal emotion, as Shepard adds a sympathetic edge to the violent rage that overtakes the second half.—""The Right Stuff"" trailer‘The Right Stuff’Where to watch: Amazon Video, iTunes, Vudu, Google PlaySave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeShepard earned an Academy Award nomination for his performance as Chuck Yeager, a dedicated pilot who would never let something like safety stop him from breaking his own speed records. Shepard invested that jock-ish character with a sincere and noble drive to do right by his country and humanity, turning Yeager’s inspiring journey to space into a rousing story of someone who transcends his humble beginnings. Yeager’s final flight (and his insistence on walking himself to the ambulance after his jet crashes and burns) forms the emotional crux of the film, a stirring testament to what brave people can accomplish through sheer force of will.—""Paris, Texas"" trailer‘Paris, Texas’Where to watch: Amazon Video, iTunes, FilmStruckSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeShepard shared screenwriting credit for this Wim Wenders film about an existential road trip of penance. The script is somewhat sparse, but every word the characters speak is packed with meaning. In one of cinema’s greatest monologues, the haunted Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) finally reunites with his long-lost lover, Jane (Nastassja Kinski), and retells the story of their troubled, tragic relationship through a one-way pane of glass.

For Michael Almereyda’s modern-day reimagining of “Hamlet,” Shepard stepped in to portray the spectral apparition of Hamlet’s deceased father. The part is small but significant, effectively setting the entire plot in motion, and Shepard brought all the required gravitas to his warning from the great beyond. Appearing first as an eerie ghost on a closed-circuit TV loop, he comes to his son as a source of strength and wisdom.—""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"" trailer‘The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford’Where to watch: HBO, Amazon, iTunesSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThis revisionist Western by Andrew Dominik may revolve around the complicated dynamic between the two title characters, but Shepard proves invaluable as James’s coolheaded big brother, Frank. He’s the linchpin of an early, breathtaking scene in which the James Gang fleeces a money-freighting train in the dead of night; just as crucially, Frank recognizes that the time has come to quit while they’re ahead. His decision to split cements his reputation as the brains of the outfit, the only one who can see the big picture of crime and how short its shelf life really is. Shepard exuded a sense of savvy in the role, and his steady self-assurance as a screen presence made it feel genuine.—Correction: Aug. 2, 2017An earlier version of this article misidentified Chuck Yeager as an astronaut.

"THE CHANGELINGBy Victor LaValle431 pp. Spiegel & Grau. $28.“I think I hate those fairy tales,” an evil old man declares in Victor LaValle’s strange and wonderful new novel, “The Changeling.” “Not really the tales, but how they end. Three words that ruin everything. ‘Happily ever after.’” Everybody’s a critic, especially in New York City, where this bitter man lives and where virtually the entirety of LaValle’s story — which is a fairy tale — takes place. (The urban action is interrupted only by a couple of nervous forays into the terra incognita of Nassau County.) In New York, its natives know, there’s no such thing as “ever after”: Everything changes, all the time, and the best we can do is plant our feet and hold on tight, straphangers on the hurtling express train of fate. The three words (spoiler alert) are in fact uttered on the last page of “The Changeling,” but LaValle revises them as soon as they’ve been spoken. He’s a New Yorker, Queens-raised. He gets that happiness isn’t somewhere you live forever; it’s an apartment whose rent isn’t stabilized, much less controlled.“The Changeling,” it should be noted, is a particular kind of fairy tale: “the old kind,” in the words of the omniscient narrator, “when such stories were meant for adults, not kids.” Once upon a time, that is. LaValle begins his tale way back in 1968, in the brief Fun City era of Mayor John Lindsay, at a moment that foreshadowed the city’s darker days of the ’70s: A sanitation workers’ strike is in progress, and the streets of all five boroughs are piling fast with uncollected garbage. In this fetid atmosphere, two Queens residents meet: “Lillian Kagwa emigrated from Uganda,” the narrator tells us, in a knowing magic-realist tone, “while Brian West arrived from the only slightly less foreign territory of Syracuse.” It’s love at first sight for Brian, a parole officer keeping an eye on Lillian’s boss, but not for her. She’s had a rougher life; she’s warier. But Brian persists and is gradually, eventually rewarded. They marry and have a son, whom they name Apollo. “And they lived happily ever after,” the narrator says. “At least for a few years.” Next paragraph: “By Apollo’s fourth birthday Brian West was gone.” So that’s the kind of fairy tale this is going to be.Then, having abruptly wakened his audience from one happily-ever-after reverie, LaValle dares us to dream another, if we can, this time a coming-of-age story in which young Apollo grows up to become a dealer in used and rare books, finds true love in the form of a strong and comely librarian named Emma, and has a son of his own, whom they call Brian, after the vanished father. Despite the warnings we’ve been given, the teller’s calm, lulling voice draws us in again, fills our childlike imaginations with the hope that this time things will turn out differently. And they do: What befalls Apollo and Emma and little Brian is much more terrible.Image Credit James Nieves/The New York TimesThe book’s title hints at the nature of the catastrophe, but doesn’t fully convey the sheer force of it, the gut-punch shock LaValle delivers to his trusting readers. As his Lovecraftian novella “The Ballad of Black Tom” showed just a year ago, he’s not timid either about conjuring horrors or about describing the emotions they evoke in their unfortunate victims. His horrors hurt, and keep hurting for a good while after the worst seems to be over. Apollo, in the months after the apparent end of his happiness, finds himself reliving the dire events and running around the city — mostly using public transportation — in a desperate attempt to make some sense of what’s happened to him. He’s like a knight on a melancholy, half-crazed quest, which brings him to a secret community of women on an abandoned island in the East River, and from there to a cemetery on Long Island, where he feels he’s reached “the farthest landmark on this new map of the spectral territories. Ultima Thule of grief.” And still there’s farther for him to go, deep into the wilderness of Forest Park in Queens, where something uncanny (and disturbingly large) lives. Survival in New York City is a challenge at the best of times, for everybody, but this hero’s ordeals, by water and fire and social media, are sterner trials of faith than even the mad monks of the Inquisition could dream up. They’re worse than a garbage strike.",movies

Theater managers in several Chinese cities confirmed on Wednesday that they had received the order, which went into effect last week.Besides “socialist core values,” the videos promote President Xi Jinping’s cherished “Chinese dream” and two other Communist Party slogans, the “Four Comprehensives” and the “Five in One Overall Arrangement.”",movies
"“Buried Child” (1978) won the Pulitzer Prize for drama and remains Mr. Shepard’s best-known work. It arrived on Broadway in 1996 and has been revived many times since — the most recent staging, by the New Group Off Broadway in 2016, starred Ed Harris. Richard Eder reviewed the premiere, at the small Theater for the New City downtown:Sam Shepard does not merely denounce chaos and anomie in American life, he mourns over them. His corrosive images and scenes of absurdity never soften to concede the presence of a lament, but it is there all the same. Denunciation that has no pity in it is pamphleteering at best and a striking of fashionable attitudes at worst, and it is fairly common on the contemporary stage. Mr. Shepard is an uncommon playwright and uncommonly gifted and he does not take denouncing for granted. He wrestles with it at the risk of being thrown.Mr. Harris also starred in the New York premiere of “Fool for Love,” in 1983. Here is what Frank Rich had to say:It could be argued, perhaps, that both the glory and failing of Mr. Shepard’s art is its extraordinary afterlife: His works often play more feverishly in the mind after they’re over than they do while they’re before us in the theater. But that’s the way he is, and who would or could change him?Ben Brantley reviewed Mr. Shepard’s latest play, “A Particle of Dread (Oedipus Variations),” in 2014:Mr. Shepard is (I think) trying to get at the ways we all are all haunted by the primal myths that run through our civilizations. Think of this fixation, if you wish, as a sort of cultural original sin. And no matter how “advanced” our scientific and intellectual investigations and theorizing, those myths retain a hold on us that can never be erased or even clinically assessed.Books",movies

Its first installment, “Babe,” which Miller produced and helped write, fuses ahead-of-their-time special effects with a heartwarming lead performance by James Cromwell, telling the sweet story of a porcine underdog who yearns to herd sheep and the farmer who believes he can do it. Miller stepped into the director’s chair for the sequel — which, with its surreal art direction and bizarre menagerie of human and animal characters, “Pig in the City” is barely a children’s movie.

"Watching is The New York Times’s TV and film recommendation newsletter and website.This weekend, let’s first revisit two of the biggest achievements of the director George Romero and the actor Martin Landau, both of whom died last weekend: one that effectively invented the modern zombie flick, and the other, for which Landau earned his only Oscar. In keeping with the genre spirit of those two films, I’ve also excavated another gruesome favorite that only recently became available to stream. So pull up the covers, leave the lights on if you have to, and enjoy this terrorizing triple feature.""Night Of The Living Dead"" trailer.George Romero’s debut feature, “Night of the Living Dead,” is the granddaddy of all zombie movies, having established the slow-walking, ever-hungry-for-the-living dead as a horror-picture trope for what seems to be the rest of time: Countless other zombies have appeared in movies since its 1968 release (and in a certain popular TV show), and most have stuck to or riffed off Romero’s model. Romero worked on a shoestring budget in Pittsburgh in order to bring his apocalyptic vision to life, and his casting of a black actor as the lead (Duane Jones) challenged racial prejudices in an unconventional way. The film’s plot became a successful blueprint, too, in which a group of mismatched survivors must band together to survive attacks from the flesh-eating dead.""Ed Wood"" trailer.‘Ed Wood’Where to watch: Rent it on iTunes,Rent it on Amazon Google Play and other platforms.

It’s Argento’s nightmarish vision that makes this supernatural thriller so exceptional. Many scenes are awash with contrasting red and green lights, a foreboding sign of spookier things to come. A bass-heavy score underlines the feeling of dread throughout the film, enhancing the sense of paranoia that grows with each twist. “Suspiria” is a rare woman-led horror film, and one of the few set in a ballet school.0",movies
"If there’s one constant in samurai movies, it’s that their heroes are ridiculously hard to kill, battling on through every assault short of being blown to smithereens. Imagine, then, how much tougher to dispatch is a samurai whose wounds — the physical ones, anyway — heal themselves, and you have a fair idea of the sheer volume of damage visited on Manji (Takuya Kimura), the justifiably grumpy centerpiece of Takashi Miike’s “Blade of the Immortal.”Adding a soupçon of sorcery to the genre’s typical vengeance saga, Manji’s immortality effectively embellishes the slice-and-dice dust-ups that propel the plot and punctuate Tetsuya Oishi’s screenplay. (As it happens, Manji can be rubbed out, just exceedingly slowly — like, over years.) Based on the eponymous long-running manga series by Hiroaki Samura, the story opens on a stunning black-and-white battle that leaves Manji mortally wounded and his little sister slain.Out of nowhere, an ancient crone appears and stuffs sacred worms into his wounds. Like slimy paramedics, the creatures rejoin his gashes and gloppily reattach his severed hand, but Manji feels more cursed than blessed. And when the movie leaps 50 years ahead and bursts into color we find him scarred, reclusive and not at all eager to help a young girl named Rin (Hana Sugisaki) avenge the murder of her parents. But Rin looks exactly like his sister, and a “True Grit” connection develops that will send them on one of the bloodiest quests in samurai history.It’s also one of the most bonkers. Single-handedly facing down a succession of riverine hordes, Manji also has to dodge ultra-colorful weaponry — like blades cunningly designed to relocate your insides to your outsides — and an array of fancifully coifed and costumed lone opponents. These include a lithe young swordswoman, bravely defying the constraints of a purple maxi skirt and platform sandals; a masked monster with dead heads strapped to his shoulders; a fellow immortal who’s 200 years old and ready to die after seeing five wives to their graves. (A conservative number, I thought, for two centuries.)",movies
"Perhaps the most delightful of Jean Renoir’s films, “The Crime of Monsieur Lange” is a defense of murder — on political grounds.The movie is so jaunty that it could easily be reconceived as a musical comedy, albeit one that could never have been made in Hollywood, even before the Production Code. Indeed, “Monsieur Lange,” which was released in France in 1936, would have to wait 28 years for its American theatrical premiere.Structurally, “Monsieur Lange” — at Film Forum for a week in a new digital restoration — is a sort of trial. On the lam and making for the border, the naïve, unexpectedly successful pulp writer Amédée Lange (René Lefèvre) and his lover, the vivacious laundress Valentine (Florelle, a star at the Moulin Rouge), stop for the night in a rural inn and are recognized as fugitives. While the exhausted Lange sleeps, the irrepressible Valentine explains why he shot his erstwhile employer, the unscrupulous publisher Batala (Jules Berry), and, acting as a de facto lawyer, argues Lange’s case before a suitably proletarian jury.The movie unfolds in flashback. Lange, whose invented alter ego is the western hero Arizona Jim, is a dreamer. Batala, a fast-talking swindler, is the reality principle. (Berry’s cynical seducer anticipates his role as the Devil in Marcel Carné’s wartime fantasy “Les Visiteurs du Soir.”) After Batala skips town ahead of his creditors, Lange and his associates turn the press into a self-governing workers’ cooperative, founded largely on the popularity of Arizona Jim.

"MOVIES THAT MATTEREDMore Reviews From a Transformative DecadeBy Dave Kehr220 pp. University of Chicago. Cloth, $75. Paper, $22.50.Image“Movies That Mattered” is a sequel to “When Movies Mattered” (2011). Together, the books mostly collect Kehr’s reviews from The Chicago Reader and Chicago magazine, published between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s. In a glowing foreword, Jonathan Rosenbaum, himself a distinguished reviewer-cum-film scholar, calls Kehr’s reviews “the most remarkable extended stretch of auteurist criticism in American journalism,” and then proceeds to thank him for ensuring that Rosenbaum inherited his slot at The Reader when Kehr left. But this turns out to be a false alarm. Rosenbaum is right: Kehr’s writing on film is extraordinary.Now a film curator at the Museum of Modern Art, Kehr displays a broad and varied taste, ranging from the high (Robert Bresson’s “L’Argent”) to the low (Russ Meyer’s “Supervixens”) and everything in between. He displays a keen grasp of the ways in which films work — the play of images, words, gestures and pacing — without losing sight of the historical context in which they live and breathe. In an essay on the death of the western, for example, he rightly identifies the paradox of the genre as the employment of the lawless to establish the law, a contradiction that was done in by the cynicism that followed in the wake of the Vietnam War, when both the law and the lawless lost their appeal.Kehr covers some 40 films, interspersing them with think pieces, a book review and career assessments of his favorite auteurs. The 1980s were not the most salubrious decade in which to shine as a movie reviewer. Movies plummeted from the peaks they reached in the 1970s, but as with all the great reviewers — Pauline Kael, Andrew Sarris, Manny Farber — Kehr’s reviews fly free from their ostensible subjects to become species of cultural criticism. Agree with his opinions or not, they’re always smart, lucid, well argued and witty. This book is a pleasure to read.",movies
"The movie is Joan’s trial in both senses of the word. The Hungarian film theorist Bela Balazs described the film’s inquisition scene as a duel in which “it is looks that are crossed, not swords.” The intensity of Falconetti’s performance is all but unparalleled. (The only equivalent in silent cinema that comes to mind are Lillian Gish’s solo scenes in Victor Sjostrom’s 1928 melodrama “The Wind.”) Cast wildly against type (Falconetti had been known for light romantic roles), she embodies a spiritual anguish worthy of a medieval Pietà. Eyes widened and miraculously capable of dropping a single tear, her Joan is dazed yet resolute. When the clerics accuse her of being sent by the Devil, she accuses them of the same. “This woman’s arrogance is outrageous,” one title reads.Although “Joan” has the sense of a slow crucifixion, it is often frenzied. Dreyer’s camera is frequently in motion, at times hysterically so. “Joan” is not just a movie shot largely in close-up, but one without establishing shots. Dreyer accentuates this disorientation through maneuvers that have no technical name — turning the camera upside down, having it pirouette to follow an action as it is reflected in a puddle of water, or moving the camera forward to recoil quickly. The editing is no less kinetic.Given this percussive montage, Dreyer was taken by some contemporary critics as an admirer of the Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein. If anything, he was a rival. Dreyer’s editing is not only strongly rhythmic, but also daringly disjunctive in its use of jump-cuts and deliberate mismatches. Space, already deranged by off-balanced compositions and unusual angles, is thoroughly pulverized. The ending, as the crowd riots and is beaten by English soldiers while Joan burns, could almost be Dreyer’s answer to the “Odessa Steps” sequence from Eisenstein’s “Battleship Potemkin.”",movies
"Though I come on my mother’s side from a long line of Shiites, who encourage public grieving through institutionalized mourning called matam, there’s little I find more mortifying than crying in front of strangers. Matam is the act of grieving Imam Hussain, the Prophet Muhammad’s grandson, who was martyred along with his followers in a bloody battle in the year 680. Our tears and self-flagellations are meant to be in remembrance of Hussain’s agony, but it’s actually a chance for us to grieve about our own quotidian sufferings. It’s difficult not to cry when you attend a majlis, or the congregation for matam.My mother, my aunts, my grandmother and her sisters have between them survived multiple wars, a violent escape from their small town in what is now India during the Partition and an economic exodus that took their children and grandchildren to far-flung places like Minneapolis and Indianapolis, the opposite end of the world from Pakistan. Still, they don’t really cry outside a majlis. The ritual allows them to break down without any of the judgment that is otherwise associated with being a wailing woman in public. The few times I’ve been with them, I sat on the floor in the ladies’ section of the mosque and watched as they dissolved into sobbing, shaking piles of dark fabric. My face stayed dry.I pride myself in rarely crying or displaying any emotion at all, so having panic attacks meant my anxieties came out all at once. They weren’t expected, and their erratic appearances are precisely what made them debilitating. At my worst, I convinced myself that my fear of weeping on planes would stop me from flying altogether, but then I began relishing the idea of flipping through the in-flight movie catalog on a clumsy touch-screen, calmly selecting a straight-to-DVD film that would reduce me to tears.On a plane, the principles of film selection are suspended as long as we’re at cruising altitude: It’s fine — welcome, even — to watch a bad movie. I’ve found myself dabbing my eyes through “Murder, She Baked,” a series of films created by Hallmark Movies & Mysteries, and have somehow choked up at “Taken 2” and “Taken 3” — anything in which the music swells. I had little interest in watching “Lion” in theaters or at home, but I knew it would give me the opportunity to freely weep at someone else’s anxieties instead of my own. Above all, it gave me an excuse to cry when there seemed to be a reason to, a semblance of control.By the time the plane begins its descent, I’m blotchy-eyed but emotionally sound; I’m still riding the high of postcrying calmness while standing in the airport taxi line. The rhythm to the ritual is comforting enough that I don’t even need to discreetly nibble off-brand Xanax in my seat; it has replaced my new-age meditation completely. The idea of letting my weepy alter-ego make a controlled appearance is so appealing that I sometimes wonder whether I travel just to give my tear ducts a test run.",movies
"The movie is streaming — supposedly — on the app of the cable channel Starz. I normally gain access to this app through my cable provider user ID and password, but when I tried to watch the film that way on my iPad, a black screen and a message, in a very elegant typeface, appeared instead: “First, a quick piece of business: While you now have access to tons of your favorite stuff, this title isn’t offered by your provider. We’re confident that you’ll find more of the obsessable series and movies that you crave.” Let the subscriber beware. I was able to watch “Planes, Trains and Automobiles” on Starz through Amazon Channels, and remind me to cancel that subscription before my seven-day free trial runs out (oops, too late now).The movie is brisk and consistently funny, and it hits the sentiment bone in a smart, relatively honest way. The slow-burn rage of Mr. Martin against the oblivious amiability of Mr. Candy (his character’s signature line: “The last thing I want to be remembered as is an annoying blabbermouth”) remains a spectacular comedic blend. As is customary with films written and directed by John Hughes in the 1980s, there’s an American class-analysis subtext that holds the characterizations together: Mr. Martin’s aspirational hauteur is the irresistible force bulldozing into the immovable object of Mr. Candy’s just-folks awkwardness. The language is still super-salty even by today’s standards, so it might not be fun for the entire family.The second, “Home for the Holidays” (1995), is something that looks like it ought to get by on its cast alone: Holly Hunter, Robert Downey Jr., Anne Bancroft, Charles Durning, Geraldine Chaplin and Claire Danes. Not to mention Dylan McDermott, Cynthia Stevenson, and Steve Guttenberg cast against type as an uptight in-law. As it happens, the movie, directed by Jodie Foster, has got even more going for it. While you wouldn’t want to call it prescient, Ms. Hunter’s character, Claudia, an artist turned restorer, is the kind of career-challenged bohemian whose status remains relevant today. Mr. Downey’s frenetic gay brother is also refreshing in his nonstereotypical quirkiness. The family-is-almost-all-we’ve-got theme is a little pat but not totally cringeworthy. It’s a smile-inducing sit, rated PG-13 and free to stream on Amazon Prime.Some pictures that are not entirely set on Thanksgiving but are popular for their funny Thanksgiving scenes include the not-entirely-good teaming of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau in “Grumpy Old Men” (1993) and “Funny People” (2009), which features Adam Sandler giving a doozy of a Thanksgiving toast. (“Grumpy Old Men” is available free for Hulu subscribers, and both films can be rented or purchased via Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, Microsoft and Fandango Now.) If you’re not in the mood to watch all of “Funny People,” there’s a clip Fandango put up on YouTube. (It’s good, but not quite as trenchant as the short film of William S. Burroughs’s “Thanksgiving Prayer,” also on YouTube and definitely not family fare since it, for instance, gives “thanks for a country where nobody is allowed to mind his own business; thanks for a nation of finks.”)When I’m inclined to recreate my Thanksgiving movie reveries of old, well, I cannot tell a lie: I will go with my nice Blu-ray Disc of the 1933 original of “King Kong.” The movie is still enough of a classic that there’s nowhere you can stream it free (legally). But you can rent or buy it from Amazon, iTunes and the other usual suspects. If you’re a premium member at Warner Archive, that streaming service offers the agreeable not-quite-sequel “Son of Kong,” featuring the great beast’s far-less-terrifying-but-still-engaging offspring. “King Kong vs. Godzilla” has yet to hit streaming services, but several ’60s Japanese monster movies, from “Godzilla” itself to the definitively odd “War of the Gargantuas,” have just landed in the aforementioned Starz app, although, again, if you’re going through your cable provider, you might not be able to access them. In which case, there’s always football.",movies

"GLENN KENNY The opera tells this peculiar story clearly and strongly. You can, I think, go into the Met with no idea of the source material and experience a work that speaks to you. But people should watch the film regardless! It’s one of Buñuel’s most enigmatic and entertaining works. It feels very deadpan, almost tossed off, which is a key feature of his style. The opera is more, well, operatic.I think Buñuel understood and loved music as much as any other film director. But the movies from his fecund late period in France don’t have musical scores. There’s music in some of them — memorably, the flamenco that Ángela Molina dances to in “That Obscure Object of Desire” — but no scores. The music in those late films is mostly in their rhythms. In “Belle de Jour,” when the film wants to convey the disjointed consciousness and subconscious of its conflicted heroine, her memories and fantasies are cut with a syncopated abruptness.WALLS This is one of the biggest hurdles for a composer trying to adapt Buñuel: defining in music something that originally had little of it. Mr. Adès responds to the challenge with a crazily varied score. His earlier works have exhibited some similar traits; his 1995 opera “Powder Her Face” is full of self-consciously outrageous winking.But his sounds here are stranger and funnier. He emphasizes the situation’s surrealism with his choice of instruments, like the ondes Martenot and its ethereal, swooping tones. Miniature violins and a salad bowl are included.",movies

Although “42” is as straightforward a biopic as they come, Boseman’s performance is phenomenal and Harrison Ford, who plays the Dodgers’ gruff executive, Branch Rickey, seems to relish the role of curmudgeonly good guy.

Even our heroes aren’t immune to tragedy. Hilary Swank plays an unmarried woman on the American frontier in the 1850s, who agrees to transport three mentally ill women to a church that will care for them. She rescues Jones’s character, a land thief, and ropes him into helping her cross the frontier. Unfortunately, their good intentions do nothing to help their personal failings.—0Netflix Original TV SeriesSarah Gadon in “Alias Grace.” Sabrina Lantos/Netflix‘Alias Grace’Starts streaming: Nov. 3Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThe novelist Margaret Atwood provided the source material for Hulu’s Emmy-winning “The Handmaid’s Tale,” and now Netflix counters with this actively feminist adaptation of another Atwood novel. Written by Sarah Polley (“Stories We Tell”) and directed by Mary Harron (“American Psycho”), this mini-series stars Sarah Gadon as Grace, a convicted killer who becomes the patient of an innovative mid-19th century criminal psychologist played by Edward Holcroft. As the doctor interviews this outwardly genteel woman, he learns the story of how she emigrated from Ireland to Canada, exposing him to the harrowing secrets shared among so many working-class women.—Maria Bamford, left, and Ana Gasteyer in “Lady Dynamite.” Beth Dubber/Netflix‘Lady Dynamite’ Season 2Starts streaming: Nov. 10Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThe first season of this meta-sitcom from Maria Bamford was a surprisingly uncompromising extension of her edgy stand-up act, which has always mixed childlike whimsy and frank observations about her shaky mental health. The second season will lean even further into thinly disguised autobiography, as the TV version of Maria tries to keep a new romance alive while following her comedy career into a job at a Netflix-like subscription streaming service. Expect more anxiety, more absurdity and more surprise cameos from Bamford’s A-list comedian pals.—Robert Taylor in “Longmire.” John Golden Britt/Netflix‘Longmire’ Season 6Starts streaming: Nov. 17Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeGiven the recent popularity of 21st century westerns like “Hell or High Water” and “Wind River,” it’s a shame that this TV adaptation of the Walt Longmire mystery novels by Craig Johnson never found a big audience. After three years on A&E and two on Netflix, the show comes to an end with one final, 10-episode season, wrapping up the story of a Wyoming sheriff (Robert Taylor) who’s battled political rivals and managed jurisdictional disputes with the local Native American population, all while tracking criminals across the High Plains.—Jon Bernthal in “The Punisher.” Jessica Miglio/Netflix‘The Punisher’Starts streaming: Nov. 17Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeJust a few months after bringing together Daredevil, Iron Fist, Luke Cage and Jessica Jones in “The Defenders,” the Marvel TV Universe forges ahead with its long-awaited “Daredevil” spinoff, focused on a violent, vengeful vigilante. Jon Bernthal reprises his role as Frank Castle, who over the decades has been one of the comics’ more controversial characters because of his willingness to punish criminals in the most extreme manner possible. This isn’t likely to be Netflix’s first lighthearted Marvel show, in other words.—Michelle Dockery in “Godless.” Ursula Coyote/Netflix‘Godless’Starts streaming: Nov. 22Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeSteven Soderbergh jumps back into TV, working with his “Out of Sight” screenwriter, Scott Frank, to produce this original western mini-series. Jeff Daniels stars as a bitter outlaw who tracks his traitorous ex-partner (Jack O’Connell) to a strange New Mexico mining town, which has been functioning as a matriarchy since a disaster killed nearly all of the men. Michelle Dockery, Scoot McNairy, Merritt Wever, Sam Waterston and Kim Coates fill out this story of father-figures, mother-figures and the struggle for power in a lawless land.—DeWanda Wise and Anthony Ramos in “She’s Gotta Have It.” David Lee/Netflix‘She’s Gotta Have It’Starts streaming: Nov. 23Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThe indie film hero Spike Lee revisits his breakthrough film from 1986, converting it into a half-hour sitcom. The original “She’s Gotta Have It” was a dazzlingly creative and funny film, but it contained some dodgy sexual politics. Here’s hoping that the proudly promiscuous heroine, Nola Darling (played this time by DeWanda Wise), has been brought more up-to-date. Recent Lee movies like “Da Sweet Blood of Jesus” and “Chi-Raq” have shown that he hasn’t lost his cinematic daring, so no matter what this series turns out to be, it will probably be a must-see.—Netflix Original FilmsMary J.

After her sensitive breakout drama, “Pariah,” and the HBO biopic “Bessie,” Rees takes on this epic story of loss and racism. Featuring a large cast that includes Carey Mulligan, Mary J. Blige, Garrett Hedlund, Jason Mitchell and Jason Clarke, “Mudbound” is the tale of two families, one black and one white, whose lives become tragically intertwined in the years after World War II. The movie’s scope and beauty are breathtaking; its story is heartbreaking.—Jim Carrey in “Man on the Moon.” Francois Duhamel/Universal Studios, via Netflix‘Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond — Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton’Starts streaming: Nov. 17Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeJim Carrey looks back at one of his greatest big-screen performances, in which he played the avant-garde comedian Andy Kaufman in the 1999 biopic “Man on the Moon.” A new interview with Carrey is intercut with behind-the-scenes footage from the movie’s set, creating an intimate account of how an actor immerses himself in a role — and how much trickier that becomes when he’s portraying someone as mercurial and puckish as Kaufman.—0New to Amazon PrimeJack Nicholson, left, and Matt Damon in “The Departed.” Andrew Cooper/Warner Bros. Pictures‘The Departed’Starts streaming: Nov. 1Nov. 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThere’s so much double-crossing in this gangster movie, it’s almost hard to keep track of who’s a crooked cop and who’s a criminal. Martin Scorsese directs an absurdly formidable cast — including Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson and Mark Wahlberg — through this complicated story set in Boston. Scorsese shows a lot of love for the setting, from the Massachusetts State House to the dive bars where the gangsters hang out.

Ledger plays a squire who finds his way into the royals-only sport of jousting and puts the snobby nobles in their place. There’s love and adventure, and there are friends made along the way, including Geoffrey Chaucer (Paul Bettany), a writer who regularly loses his clothes for some reason.

On the run from cops, Downey’s rascally criminal accidentally enters an acting audition that leads him into a “Chinatown”-like caper involving an old friend (Michelle Monaghan) and a cynical detective (Val Kilmer, doing the most with his turtleneck-heavy wardrobe). And it’s all set during Christmas because that’s just the director Shane Black’s thing.—Jenny Slate, left, and Abby Quinn in “Landline.” Linda Kallerus/Amazon Studios‘Landline’Starts streaming: Nov. 17Nov. 17 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeDirector Gillian Robespierre’s follow-up to her bittersweet comedy “Obvious Child” follows a New York City family’s messy relationships — with one another, and with ’90s technology — after the youngest child, Ali (Abby Quinn), discovers emails from her father (John Turturro) to a secret lover on the shared family desktop. This movie can be funny, sweet, dark and playfully nostalgic, but it doesn’t leave its characters stranded amid the pop-culture references.—Zoe Kazan and Kumail Nanjiani in “The Big Sick.” Lionsgate‘The Big Sick’Starts streaming: Nov. 24Nov. 24 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeI think Amazon is trying to make me feel better about how much food I plan on eating Thanksgiving weekend by putting one of my favorite comedies of the year on Prime. In this semi-autobiographical romantic comedy, a stand-up comedian named Kumail (played by Kumail Nanjiani) and a grad student named Emily (Zoe Kazan, playing Nanjiani’s real-life wife, Emily V. Gordon) meet, fall in love and break up before Emily lands in the hospital with a mysterious illness. The nightmarish situation pushes Kumail to bond with her parents (played by Ray Romano and Holly Hunter, one of the year’s cutest onscreen couples), giving him hope for a chance to repair his relationship. The movie isn’t one-sided about the immigrant experience, as Kumail also has to confront the cultural and generational divisions between him and his tradition-minded parents.—Viola Davis and Denzel Washington in “Fences.” David Lee/Paramount Pictures‘Fences’Starts streaming: Nov. 24Nov. 24 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeDenzel Washington directs and stars in this adaptation of the August Wilson play, and his performance swings for the ... well, you get it.

Rachel Brosnahan stars as a housewife who starts telling jokes on stage — and soon becomes a sensation — after her husband leaves her. Sherman-Palladino brings her usual fast-paced, funny dialogue to a story that partly echoes the experiences of pioneering comics like Joan Rivers, and partly speaks to what it’s always been like to be a woman in showbiz.—New to HuluJulie Hagerty in “Airplane!” Paramount Pictures‘Airplane!’Starts streaming: Nov. 1Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeTaking on the super serious — if at times silly — genre of disaster movies, “Airplane!” is an absolutely ridiculous comedy with a script full of bad puns, dirty jokes and utter absurdity. Many chaotic stories swirl around this troubled flight, but Leslie Nielsen’s character is a deadpan calm in the middle of a slapstick storm.—0Yu Fei Hong and Russell Wong in “The Joy Luck Club.” Hollywood Pictures, via Everett Collection‘The Joy Luck Club’Starts streaming: Nov. 1Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeAdapted from the best-selling novel by Amy Tan, “The Joy Luck Club” follows the stories of four Chinese women, their journey to the United States and their Chinese-American daughters who try to balance both cultures. It’s a women-centric story that’s also realistic and accepting — the kind of movie we don’t often see from Hollywood. (Sorry, “Bad Moms” does not count.)—Stephen Chow (in white) in “Kung Fu Hustle.” Sony Pictures Classic‘Kung Fu Hustle’Starts streaming: Nov. 1Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeNot many Chinese movies made their way to my corner of Florida when I was growing up, but this ridiculous, over-the-top action movie did. The director and star Stephen Chow tapped martial arts movie motifs and mixed slapstick jokes with wire-Fu (the kind of unreal kung fu that looks as if everyone is flying), creating a truly bizarre spectacle about a would-be gangster who attempts to join a lethal group of martial arts masters.—Gemma Arterton in “Their Finest.” Nicola Dove/STX Entertainment‘Their Finest’Starts streaming: Nov. 11Nov. 11 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeMuch less intense than Christopher Nolan’s “Dunkirk,” this movie is a charming romantic drama about the making of a movie about Dunkirk in the 1940s. In “Their Finest,” Catrin (Gemma Arterton) is a plucky secretary who lands a job as a scriptwriter for propaganda movies. She finds a story of two sisters who rescued men fleeing from Dunkirk — inspiring but not particularly exciting without a few rewrites. Despite the number of onscreen tragedies, the movie’s heroine resolutely keeps her head up and carries on. The movie also features veteran British actors like Bill Nighy, Richard E.

"A No Wave Super 8 film writ large, Slava Tsukerman’s “Liquid Sky” was a midnight movie that opened at normal hours 35 years ago and, although highly stylized and very much a product of its era, has remained remarkably resilient. Now, 11 months after its 35-millimeter print was said to have been retired, it returns to the Quad Cinema for a run in a crisp, new 4K digital restoration.The movie, whose title was a slang term for heroin invented by the filmmakers, is set amid the drug-addled, fashion-crazed, sexually jaded habitués of New York’s downtown demimonde. Adding to the spectacle: An unseen extraterrestrial based in a flying saucer approximately the size of a dinner plate is feeding, with deadly results, on the scene’s narcotic bliss and orgasmic energy — something that only a visiting West German scientist recognizes.Science-fiction premise aside, “Liquid Sky” is a dark comedy of manners centering on a well-bred, extremely caustic model, Margaret (Anne Carlisle); her equally acerbic male nemesis, Jimmy (also Ms. Carlisle); and her even nastier lover, Adrian (Paula E. Sheppard), an irascible dope dealer cum performance artist. Adrian’s sneering onstage persona suggests a bizarre misreading of the downtown luminaries Laurie Anderson and Klaus Nomi, but the movie’s prize scene is a rooftop fashion shoot featuring a trash-talking, mean-sex showdown between Ms. Carlisle’s two characters.",movies
"Nodding to François Truffaut’s “The 400 Blows” and Jean-Luc Godard’s “Pierrot le Fou,” “Cold Water” is a self-aware descendant of the French New Wave. Like Truffaut and Godard, Mr. Assayas turned from critic to filmmaker after a stint with Cahiers du Cinéma; the French-Hungarian actor Laszlo Szabo, a frequent supporting player in New Wave films, has a scene here as Gilles’s father. But “Cold Water,” which Mr. Assayas has characterized in some ways as being autobiographical, is even more forcefully a post-New Wave generational statement.The movie’s set piece is a gathering — too small to be a rave but too heedless and chaotic to be called a party — held on the grounds of an abandoned chateau. Christine is already there, having escaped from the mental institution where she had been hospitalized by her father. Ms. Ledoyen, herself a teenager when the movie was made, gives Christine a facade of burnished, if brittle, bravado; her fleeting expression of joyous gratitude when Gilles turns up could break your heart.As his camera prowls among the revelers, their faces illuminated by trash-can fires, Mr. Assayas demonstrates his skill as a D.J., switching back and forth between anarchic ecstasy (“School’s Out,” “Up Around the Bend”) and the voluptuously elegiac (“Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door,” “Avalanche”). The sequence is a tour de force of flaming youth. But it’s a cold morning after at the end of the road.Mr. Assayas succeeded in making a young person’s film when he was on the cusp of turning 40. He has said that he wanted “Cold Water” to feel like a movie from 1972. It doesn’t really, but, perhaps more remarkably, it’s so fresh it could have been made now.",movies

The only thing everyone had in common was that they love these movies.As day turned into night, some slept, as I did, slumped in their upright chair, airplane-style. Taking advantage of neighbors who had slipped out, some curled up on a series of empty seats. Others simply hit the floor, with backpacks and jackets as makeshift pillows and blankets. The overnight movies were complemented by the soft buzz of snoring, and the silence between lines was occasionally punctured by the pop of a particularly loud snort, which drew a chuckle from the bleary-eyed souls who were still awake.",movies
"“Cargo,” a Netflix Original movie that will have its premiere on May 18, has an exemplary slow-burn opening. On a quiet river in the middle of a beautiful Australian landscape, Andy, played by Martin Freeman, steers a houseboat. In its kitchen area, his wife, Kay, feeds their infant daughter. Things look idyllic. The boat eases toward the shoreline; some balloons in trees hint of a celebration. Andy looks across the water at a patriarchal figure, who stares back, deadeyed. The man raises his shirt to show a revolver tucked into his jeans.Andy and his family, we learn, are running out of food. Something catastrophic is afoot. The movie, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke from a screenplay by Ms. Ramke, keeps the exact nature of the calamity hidden for a good long time. Long enough that I was rather disappointed to find out … yup, flesh-eating zombie pandemic. (It was only two weeks ago that I wondered how long it would take for every region in the world to deliver its own zombie movie. We now have southern Australia covered.)But “Cargo” has more than a few terrifying, and provocative, tricks. In this movie’s zombie pandemic, people who are bitten don’t turn into flesh eaters immediately. When Andy is infected, he has 48 hours to find a nonzombie guardian for his daughter. As it happens, the indigenous people of this region seem to have a higher survival rate than others. They have gone back to the “old ways,” says Thoomi (Simone Landers, a newcomer who does excellent work), an indigenous teenage girl who befriends Andy. These ways include body and face paint to ward off the undead.One of these survivors is played by David Gulpilil, who made his screen debut in the 1971 film “Walkabout” and whose presence in Australian and Australia-set cinema (his CV includes classics like “The Last Wave, ” from 1979, and the 1986 hit “Crocodile Dundee”) has rendered him a genuine icon. Mr. Freeman, the adept comic actor, is always good playing an ordinary joe, and here he portrays one in an extraordinary jam. The movie depicts his character’s heroism without creating a “white savior” tale; instead, it advocates community and communal action.",movies

"Director Milos Forman died Friday at age 86. As one of the leading lights of the Czech New Wave in the 1960s, Forman joined a generation of young filmmakers that built a creative bulwark against communist oppression. That rebellious spirit carried over to his decades in Hollywood, from the counterculture sentiments of “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and “Hair” to his embrace of rabble-rousing iconoclasts like Larry Flynt and Andy Kaufman in “The People vs. Larry Flynt” and “Man on the Moon.”Not all of his great films are available to stream, but here are nine, including two best-picture winners, that showcase Forman’s engagement with history and politics, and with the characters willing to fight the current. If you want to check out any of the movies at a later time, save them to your Watchlist, where you can keep a personal list of TV shows and films you’d like to try out.‘The Firemen’s Ball’ (1967)Where to watch: AmazonSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeA strong anti-authoritarian streak runs through much of Forman’s work, but the controversies that greeted “The Firemen’s Ball” abruptly ended his time in communist Czechoslovakia and brought him to Hollywood. Forman denied the allegorical implications of the premise, which details the calamitous efforts of a volunteer fire department to give a party for its former leader, but the film nonetheless belongs on the satirical continuum between “Dr. Strangelove” and Armando Iannucci (“Veep,” “The Thick of It”). Over a brisk 73 minutes, the outbreak of disasters include a beauty contest with homely and stage-shy contestants, a rash of disappearing raffle prizes and an actual fire that breaks out across town.—‘Visions of Eight’ (1973)Where to watch: FilmStruck, iTunesSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeFor “Visions of Eight,” Forman and seven other internationally renowned directors were commissioned to participate in an anthology film about the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich. Forman’s “The Decathlon” is the sixth and longest, a peculiar juxtaposition of individual sporting events and musical performances, mostly from a Bavarian folk band. Each event is presented without context — his interest in documenting the winners and losers is nil — and Forman shoots extensively in slow-motion, emphasizing the pregnant moments before the athletes start to compete.—0Only three films in Oscar history have swept all five major categories (picture, actor, actress, director and screenplay): “It Happened One Night,” “The Silence of the Lambs,” and Forman’s adaptation of the novel by Ken Kesey, which frames the conflict at a mental hospital as an allegory for a polarized culture. At the center of that conflict is a battle of wills between Randal P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), a convict who bluffs his way into the psyche ward, and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who runs the place like a sinister warden. “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” has a big, generous sense of humor, but there’s humanity, too, in McMurphy’s championing of patients who are more vulnerable to Ratched’s abuses than he is.—Movieclips Classic Trailers‘Hair’ (1979)Where to watch: Amazon, iTunes, VuduSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeAfter establishing his counterculture bona fides with “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,” Forman took on the challenge of adapting Gerome Ragni and James Rado’s Broadway smash about a New York hippie enclave rebelling against the Vietnam War. There’s an urgency and danger missing from Forman’s musical, which was a decade removed from the tempest around the original production. But he brings a shaggy naturalism to “Hair” by shooting in real locations and allowing the choreography to get a little unkempt. And the songs remain terrific.—‘Ragtime’ (1981)Where to watch: Amazon, VuduSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeWhen Forman left Czechoslovakia for America, he immediately (and permanently) keyed into the dramatic crosscurrents that animated the culture, and in E.L. Doctorow’s historical novel about the early 1900s, he worked on his largest canvas to date. But rather than give “Ragtime” the “Nashville” treatment, Forman and his screenwriter, Michael Weller, focused mainly on revealing this world through the story of an African-American jazz pianist (Howard E. Rollins Jr.) who gets entangled in class and racial conflicts. A beautiful production, it also has a willingness to engage in the uncomfortable issues that continue to plague the nation.—Movieclips Classic Trailers‘Amadeus’ (1984)Where to watch: Google Play, YouTubeSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeForman collected another Oscar for best director, along with awards for best picture and six others, for this rousing adaptation of Peter Shaffer’s stage play about the rivalry between the composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham). In telling the story through Salieri’s perspective, “Amadeus” becomes a drama about deranged jealousy and betrayal as Salieri fumes over his prodigious counterpart, who is seen as immature and unworthy of his superior talent. Yet through the heat of Salieri’s contempt, Mozart’s compositions come alive with fresh urgency: “Amadeus” isn’t a stodgy costume piece for classical music fans only, it’s a gripping drama about a divine gift and its costs.—‘Valmont’ (1989)Where to buy: iTunesSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeArriving just a year after the superb “Dangerous Liaisons,” this adaptation of Pierre Choderlos de Laclos’s epistolary novel “Les Liaisons Dangereuses” was doomed to fail. And did just that, sinking under a bloated production budget and lackluster reviews. The side-to-side comparison did no favors to Forman’s version, which didn’t have the same snap, especially in the role of Valmont, which Colin Firth couldn’t play with anything close to John Malkovich’s malevolent panache. But now, from a greater distance, the virtues of “Valmont” are better appreciated, particularly Annette Bening’s deliciously nasty turn as the Marquise de Merteuil, who inspires the cruel erotic gamesmanship that eventually curdles into tragedy.—‘The People vs. Larry Flynt’ (1996)Where to watch: Amazon, VuduSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like“If the First Amendment will protect a scum bag like me, it will protect all of you.” With that quote as its prevailing sentiment, Forman’s fleet biopic about the “Hustler” pornographer turned free speech crusader Larry Flynt doesn’t underplay Flynt’s seamier side — well, maybe a little — but it does use it as a stress test for a cherished Constitutional principle. Woody Harrelson plays Flynt as an irreverent wild card whose life lurches from porn trailblazer to Christian convert, until finally landing him in a protracted legal battle with Jerry Falwell. Courtney Love is equally good as his wife Althea, whose fortunes are troubled first by addiction and later by contracting H.I.V.—Movieclips Classic Trailers‘Man on the Moon’ (1999)Where to watch: HBO, Amazon, iTunesSave To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeWorking again with the “Larry Flynt” screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, Forman sank his teeth into this lively biopic about another cultural provocateur, Andy Kaufman. Jim Carrey famously immersed himself in the role of Kaufman, the anti-comedy legend who played Latka on “Taxi” but shaped his persona in late-night and stage performances that were rife with inside jokes, offensive behavior and weird sideshows. For better or worse, Carrey sucks up much of the oxygen, but Forman’s characteristic attention to period detail helps put Kaufman’s antics in their proper cultural context.—",movies
"“First Match,” a Netflix Original movie that made its debut on March 30, begins with near-surreal imagery: a shot of a blue sky with a fluffy cloud suspended therein, into which a swatch of green flies in slow motion. Other patches of color come into the frame, items of casual clothing — a tank top, sweatpants and so on. The movie quickly gets down to earth once the viewer has figured out what the objects are. On the sidewalk, a teenage girl yells up to a window at the woman throwing the clothes from a high floor of an urban housing project. The exchange is too profane to be quoted here, but the combatants are a woman and her foster daughter, and their fight is about a man. The girl, indignant, gathers up the clothes and stalks away; there’s a genuine truculence in her step.In the next scene the viewer learns that the accusations are true. The girl, Monique, is romantically involved with her foster mother’s partner. Boyfriends are not all she steals. We also see Monique filching jewelry.“First Match” is the first feature film from the writer-director Olivia Newman, and it’s noteworthy in several respects — the first being that it does not do much from the outset to make its central character, played with vivid ferocity by Elvire Emanuelle, conventionally likable. The viewer grows to understand and root for her, but it takes some time.Monique, or “Mo,” has an absent father whom she idolizes. Back in the day he was a school wrestling star, and a composition book containing his clippings and journal entries seems to be the only thing in the world that Monique cherishes.",movies
"The good news for anyone who finds the Tribeca Film Festival daunting is that the event, which starts Wednesday, is about the same size as last year’s slimmed-down edition — not that that’s terribly slim. At 101 new features, the program is smaller than Sundance’s was in January but larger than the typical official selection at Cannes, which takes place in May.Without the auteurs or marquee titles of those festivals, Tribeca can leave the average moviegoer lost for guidance. Plot summaries aren’t much use, given that the festival often appears to have two films for every premise. (Interested in a satire about buffoons who try to market an absurd product in China? You have options.)The only way to find good movies at Tribeca is to watch them. That task requires long hours, an unflagging optimism that the next film might be a masterpiece and, mostly, a colossal stubborn streak. I’ve seen 40 new fiction features and documentaries and sampled about two dozen more. Here, in honor of the festival’s 17th year, are 17 titles I enjoyed.",movies
"Welcome to Watching, The New York Times’s TV and movie recommendation site.Every month, Netflix Canada adds a new batch of movies and TV shows to its library. Here are the titles we think are most interesting for April, broken down by release date. Netflix occasionally changes schedules without giving notice. (Unfortunately, streaming information provided in our Watchlist listings applies only to viewers in the United States.)Movies New to Netflix‘By the Sea’Starts streaming: April 1Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape Like“Brangelina” may no longer exist to feed the tabloids, but the glamour and tumult of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s relationship is preserved forever in Jolie’s “By the Sea,” an underrated melodrama that didn’t get much of a chance in theaters. Pitt and Jolie star as an unhappily married couple who hole up in a seaside hotel in France in the mid-1970s, hoping to rekindle their relationship, but they mostly retreat to their separate corners. That changes when they discover a hole in the wall and start spying on the newlyweds next door.—‘Elizabeth’Starts streaming: April 1April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeHistorical accuracy bends — and then cracks, and then shatters into a million pieces — in this 1998 costume drama, which conceives the rise to power of Elizabeth I as a tale of diabolical cunning and feminine resolve. Although “Elizabeth” brings a conspicuously modern perspective to events that took place in the 16th century, the film works as a stylish vehicle for Cate Blanchett, then a largely unknown actress who put herself firmly on the map with this film. Blanchett plays Elizabeth as a political naïf who grows into the role quickly and sees power as a means toward personal happiness.—‘Pride & Prejudice’Starts streaming: April 1Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeJane Austen aficionados may blanch at the surface-level sleekness of this 2005 adaptation from Joe Wright, which couldn’t be further from the six-hour BBC standard from a decade earlier. But taken on its own terms, “Pride & Prejudice” is a fetching, romantic drama that still does justice to its source. Wright emphasizes the humble, mud-caked state of the Bennet home, which will collapse entirely if they fail to marry off their five daughters, including the headstrong Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), who doesn’t want her suitors chosen for her. Her suspicion of the wealthy Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), however, yields to more complicated feelings over time.—0‘An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power’Starts streaming: April 2Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeIt may have been no more than a glorified PowerPoint presentation, but the 2006 documentary “An Inconvenient Truth” grossed $50 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo, won an Oscar for best documentary and forcefully advanced the debate on climate change, even if its arguments wound up meeting stiff political headwinds. Al Gore returns for a victory lap of sorts with “An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power,” which underlines the prescience of the first film while looking toward innovative solutions to a growing crisis. New movie, same formula: A terrifying glimpse of the coming eco-apocalypse, brightened with a glimmer of hope.—‘The Killing of a Sacred Deer’Starts streaming: April 5Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThe Greek social satirist Yorgos Lanthimos follows up “The Lobster” with another beguiling oddity about the dark mysteries of human behavior. Colin Farrell again stars as a wealthy surgeon who enters into a friendship with a disturbed young man (Barry Keoghan) in an effort to seek redemption for a past mishap on the operating table. But when the surgeon brings him home and introduces him to his wife (Nicole Kidman) and two children, the stranger’s behavior gets more threatening and compels him to make some desperate decisions. Shot with the antiseptic chill of a Michael Haneke or Stanley Kubrick production, “The Killing of a Sacred Deer” nonetheless relieves the horror with inspired bursts of black comedy.—‘The Florida Project’Starts streaming: April 6Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeSet around a purple motel in Kissimmee, Fla., a tourist trap in the shadow of Disney World, “The Florida Project” focuses on characters who can barely make the rent week-to-week, much less afford a trip to the Mouse House or take advantage of the cacophonous helicopter tours that take off nearby. Told mainly through the eyes of a six-year-old (Brooklynn Prince) who’s living with an unstable single mother (Bria Vinaite), the film is heartbreaking at times, but it is also rambunctious and funny, like a cross between “Dennis the Menace” and François Truffaut’s “Small Change.” As a put-upon yet compassionate apartment manager, Willem Dafoe embodies its unique soul.—‘The Nice Guys’Starts streaming: April 9Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeOnce upon a time, Shane Black was Hollywood’s hottest screenwriter, parlaying his standard-setting buddy comedy “Lethal Weapon” into big paydays on “The Last Boy Scout,” “Last Action Hero” and “The Long Kiss Goodnight.” But his rebirth as a writer-director in the 2000s has brought out the noir-inflected wordplay (and smarm) that always lurked in his scripts, starting with the brilliant “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” and continuing with “The Nice Guys,” which reimagines a “Chinatown”-type scenario as a bloody, sleazy, knockabout buddy picture. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling have great chemistry as a knuckle-breaker and a private eye who tackle a conspiracy that’s bigger than they can handle.—‘Monty Python and the Holy Grail’Starts streaming: April 15Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeNetflix is releasing a huge amount of Monty Python-related content on April 15, including the religious satire “Monty Python’s Life of Brian,” the legendary TV series “Monty Python’s Flying Circus,” and a host of live shows and supplementary materials. The most popular of the bunch is “Monty Python and the Holy Grail,” an irreverent goof on the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, with additional commentary on the miseries of medieval life and the absurdities of mythmaking itself. Few films have been quoted as religiously, so rewatch value is high.—‘Loving Vincent’Starts streaming: April 16Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeEvery year, the Oscar nominees for Best Animated Feature include a couple of offbeat selections from outside Hollywood, and in 2017, one of those was “Loving Vincent,” a biopic about the life of Vincent van Gogh. What sets the film apart, however, is that it is the first fully painted animated feature: Each of its 65,000 frames is an oil painting rendered in van Gogh’s unmistakable postimpressionist style, a venture that required 125 painters working at an excruciatingly slow pace. The story focuses on a letter delivered to the last place van Gogh lived and an investigation into what happened during those final days.—‘The Conjuring 2’Starts streaming: April 30Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeDirector James Wan made the seventh “The Fast and the Furious” movie between the horror movies “The Conjuring” and its sequel, but he didn’t modulate his style from one to the next in the least — lending a distinct blockbuster maximalism to the “Conjuring” movies, in a genre that usually operates on a much smaller scale. “The Conjuring 2” runs an absurd 133 minutes, but the ghost-busting adventures of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) rarely flag as they take on a vicious old spirit that has possessed a London home. As in the first entry, the Warrens have a strong, lived-in chemistry and Wan treats the haunted house like demented carnival ride of jump scares and demonic gizmos.New Netflix Original Films‘Amateur’Starts streaming: April 6Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThe writer-director Ryan Koo, who founded the D.I.Y. indie website No Film School, makes his directorial debut with what sounds like a fictionalized version of “Hoop Dreams,” following the long-shot dreams of an 8th grade basketball prospect from the inner city. Funded by a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign, “Amateur” stars Michael Rainey Jr. as a 13-year-old guard whose dazzling skills lead to a viral video and recruitment to an elite prep school, where his new coach (Josh Charles) offers himself as mentor and father figure. But at this early stop on the road to professional hoops, the possibilities for exploitation and mismanagement far exceed the odds of making millions down the line.—0‘Psychokinesis’Starts streaming: April 25Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThe South Korean director Yeon Sang-ho scored a massive hit in his home country with his 2016 horror-thriller “Train to Busan,” which distinguished itself from other zombie movies by having the undead hordes gobble up passengers on a bullet train through an apocalyptic setting. Yeon’s new film, “Psychokinesis,” arrives straight to Netflix after debuting in Korea in late January. It is another genre picture, but this time, Yeon tackles the superhero action comedy, following an ordinary man who discovers he can manipulate matter with his mind.—‘The Week Of’Starts streaming: April 27Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeWith the notable exception of Noah Baumbach’s “The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),” Adam Sandler’s multi-picture deal with Netflix has yielded some of his worst lowbrow comedies, including “The Ridiculous 6,” “The Do-Over,” and “Sandy Wexler.” Yet there’s reason to hope that “The Week of” may be an improvement, based on Sandler’s chemistry with his co-star Chris Rock and the gifted co-writer and director Robert Smigel, best known as the puppeteer behind Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog. “The Week of” stars Sandler and Rock as fathers of clashing temperament who scramble to marry off their children to each other.Netflix Original Series‘AMO’: Season 1Starts streaming: April 9Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeVeterans of the international film festival circuit will likely do a double-take in learning that Netflix has picked up a series from the Filipino director Brillante Mendoza, one of the current cinema’s most prolific and reliably controversial figures. And yet here’s “AMO,” a 13-episode crime drama about a high-school student (Vince Rillon) who sells crystal meth in a country that, under the iron-fisted rule of President Rodrigo Duterte, has brutalized drug dealers. With the street-level grittiness of previous work like “Ma’Rosa,” “Kinatay,” and “Serbis,” Mendoza seeks to reveal the human stakes of Duterte’s continuing drug war.—‘Lost in Space’: Season 1Starts streaming: April 13Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThe list of screenwriting credits for Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless — “Dracula Untold,” “The Last Witch Hunter,” “Gods of Egypt” — don’t necessarily portend great things for their reboot of the 1965 science fiction series. But Netflix has been leaning heavily on sci-fi-action and nostalgia projects lately, and the service is investing a fortune into Sazama and Sharpless’s revised take on the Robinson family and how they adjust to being stranded on an alien planet. The unnamed robot still says “Danger, Will Robinson,” but based on its appearance alone, the kitsch of the old series has been dialed back completely.—‘The Letdown’: Season 1Starts streaming: April 21Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeOn top of its originals, Netflix has been casting out for choice imports, too, and the Australian series “The Letdown” looks like its answer to the domestic chaos of Amazon’s British series “Catastrophe.” The co-creator and co-writer Alison Bell stars as an uncertain mother who starts attending a support group for new parents but discovers that the moderator (Noni Hazlehurst) doesn’t treat her charges gently. With the support group as its organizing center, “The Letdown” dives into observational humor about the exhaustion and elation of motherhood and how it upends its heroine’s life.Also of interest: “Batman: The Killing Joke” (April 1), “Batteries Not Included” (April 1), “Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story” (April 1), “Fried Green Tomatoes” (April 1), “Krampus” (April 1), “Madagascar 3: Europe’s Most Wanted” (April 1), “Ride Along” and “Ride Along 2” (April 1), “Ash vs. Evil Dead”: Season 2 (April 2), “Black Lightning”: Season 1 (April 3), “The Boss Baby: Back in Business”: Season 1 (April 6), “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” (April 15), “Monty Python’s Life of Brian” (April 15) and “The Alienist”: Season 1 (April 19).",movies

As always, expect the director-producer David Gelb and his crew to combine these chefs’ philosophical rumination on food with drool-worthy images of colorful sweets.—0‘Lost in Space’ Season 1Starts streaming: April 13Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeAlthough it only ran for three seasons in the 1960s, the family-friendly science-fiction series “Lost in Space” has maintained a steady presence in popular culture, thanks largely to its memorable characters and endearingly wonky science. Netflix’s new remake appears to be keeping most of what worked the first time out, albeit with updated special effects, and a more modern outlook on gender roles. The comically dour Dr. Smith, for example — indelibly played by Jonathan Harris in the original — is a woman in this version, and she’s played by a cleverly cast Parker Posey.—‘Bobby Kennedy for President’Starts streaming: April 27Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikePresident John F. Kennedy’s life, career and death have been covered extensively in documentaries, movie dramas, and TV mini-series, much more than his brother Robert’s political career and assassination. The four-hour docu-series “Bobby Kennedy for President” is an effort to correct that imbalance, using the landmark cultural moment of Kennedy’s 1968 White House run — and its abrupt, tragic end — as a lens through which to observe what he stood for and what he meant to a generation of young idealists.—Also of interest: “The Boss Baby: Back in Business” Season 1 (April 6), “Troy: Fall of a City’ Season 1 (April 6), “The Magic School Bus Rides Again” Season 2 (April 13), “Four Seasons in Havana” Season 1 (April 15), “The Chalet” Season 1 (April 17), “Dope” Season 2 (April 20).—Movies New to Netflix‘The Blues Brothers’Starts streaming: April 1Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikePerched between 1970s counterculture slackness and 1980s blockbuster bombast, the action-musical “The Blues Brothers” stars John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd, expanding the mythology of their R&B-loving “Saturday Night Live” characters, Jake and Elwood Blues. As the brothers reunite their old band — in order to raise money to save a Catholic orphanage — they’re pursued by various law-enforcement agencies and fringe groups. Car chases and crashes ensue, in a movie with an unusually deadpan sense of humor that gets most of its energy from performances by soul legends like Cab Calloway, James Brown, John Lee Hooker, Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin.—‘The Lobster’Starts streaming: April 1April 1 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeDirector Yorgos Lanthimos’s surreal science-fiction comedy “The Lobster” stars Colin Farrell as a sad-sack single man, in a society where adults are required to be romantically coupled. Given one last chance at love — before being turned into animal, as the law demands — the hero first becomes increasingly desperate, and then strangely drawn to a woman (played by Rachel Weisz) in a secret outsider society of rebels. Unpredictable from start to finish, “The Lobster” is a barbed satire, poking at our social conventions.—‘Interstellar’Starts streaming: April 5April 5 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeNo modern filmmaker has been as adept as director Christopher Nolan at turning personal obsessions into international box-office sensations. “Interstellar” is one of his most straightforward, crowd-pleasing pictures, starring Matthew McConaughey as a NASA pilot who takes part in a last-ditch mission to save humanity by exploring a wormhole. Yet even this film is unapologetically brainy, filled with speculative science and philosophical debates about human nature. As always, Nolan finds ways to make the cerebral viscerally exciting.—‘10 Cloverfield Lane’Starts streaming: April 6April 6 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeThe second film from producer J.J. Abrams’s science-fiction-horror franchise “Cloverfield” (and, so far, the best), “10 Cloverfield Lane” stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a woman held captive by two men, played by John Goodman and John Gallagher Jr., who claim they’re keeping her safe from a massive global attack. The heroine tries to figure out the real truth at the same time the audience does, in a tense, twisty movie that — like the other entries in this series — looks at a possibly world-ending catastrophe from a narrower, human perspective.—‘Speed’Starts streaming: April 7Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeReleased at a time when seemingly every action movie was trying (and failing), to copy “Die Hard,” this 1994 thriller offered a winning variation on the “capable loner outsmarts the genius terrorist” formula, adding humor and a strong hook. Dennis Hopper plays a madman who rigs a Los Angeles city bus with a bomb that will explode if the vehicle drops below 50 miles per hour. Keanu Reeves plays a cop who partners with a plucky passenger (played by Sandra Bullock) to keep everyone onboard from blowing up. With its unpretentious direction by Jan de Bont and a taut script by Graham Yost, “Speed” remains a prime example of how to turn a simple premise into something awesome.—0‘The Iron Giant’Starts streaming: April 12April 12 Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeBefore he directed Pixar’s massive hits “The Incredibles” and “Ratatouille,” Brad Bird directed this heartfelt, heartbreaking animated adaptation of the children’s book by Ted Hughes. Although it flopped in theaters, “The Iron Giant” has since become a cult favorite.

Franco is a heroin addict suffering through a relapse and Jacobson is the hyper-organized, straight-laced sister who spends one long, tense day trying to get him the help he needs while also making sure that his life isn’t totally upended — two goals that aren’t necessarily compatible.—‘Come Sunday’Starts streaming: April 13Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeChiwetel Ejiofor gives one of the best performances of his long, accomplished career in “Come Sunday,” playing the real-life evangelical minister Carlton Pearson, who in the early 2000s began preaching “the Gospel of Inclusion,” arguing that Jesus Christ has saved everyone regardless of a person’s religious beliefs. Directed by Joshua Marston and written by Marcus Hinchey, the film is intended as a bracing challenge to fervent Christian believers, asking them to consider the true purpose of their faith.—‘Mercury 13’Starts streaming: April 20Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeIn 1960, not long after NASA publicly announced the names of the seven pilots who became the first American men in space, a private organization started recruiting women to undergo some of the same psychological and physical tests administered to the so-called Mercury Seven. The purpose: to see if the challenges of flying beyond Earth’s atmosphere differed by gender. The documentary “Mercury 13” is a look into this lesser-known project, considering the way the codified sexism of the post-World War II era denied a one-of-a-kind opportunity to some would-be (and perfectly capable) adventurers .—‘The Week Of’Sarts streaming: April 27Save To Watch Ribbon Save to Watch Like Heart Shape LikeFor the most part, the movies that Adam Sandler has delivered to Netflix as part of his recent four-picture deal have been embarrassingly broad. But there’s reason to hope that this last film in the batch will be the best — in part because it is directed by the incisive veteran comic Robert Smigel (who also wrote the film with Sandler), and in part because it also stars Sandler’s old “Saturday Night Live” castmate Chris Rock. Sandler and Rock play parents who spend an anxious seven days leading up to their kids’ wedding. Rachel Dratch and Steve Buscemi also star, in a film that could potentially hearken to more emotionally complex Sandler projects like “The Wedding Singer.”Also of interest: “Amateur” (April 6), “The 4th Company” (April 6), “Orbiter 9” (April 6), “Pickpockets” (April 12), “Dude” (April 20), “Psychokinesis” (April 25) and “Candy Jar” (April 27).",movies

"New York Indian Film Festival (Saturday through May 14) This weeklong festival, presented by the Indo-American Arts Council and now in its 16th year, provides a survey of subcontinental cinema drawn largely from the last two years. Among the highlights is “Aligarh,” which dramatizes the true story of a gay professor. The movie, which was met with praise when it opened in India, has been cited as an example of Bollywood’s increasing open-mindedness in depictions of gay characters. The festival takes place at two locations in Manhattan: City Cinemas Village East Cinemas, 181-189 Second Avenue; and Skirball Center for the Performing Arts, 566 La Guardia Place.

(Kenigsberg)‘Trouble Every Day’ (Friday and Saturday) Never one to let sense get in the way of a good reverie or metaphor, the French director Claire Denis threw her fans for a loop with this gory 2001 tone poem. Part of Nitehawk Cinema’s late-night series “Nitehawk Nasties,” it stars two of the planet’s most animalistic actors (Vincent Gallo and Beatrice Dalle) as characters whose sexual proclivities place them somewhere on a spectrum between vampires and cannibals. Perhaps the least-loved of Ms. Denis’s features since her 1999 breakthrough, “Beau Travail,” the film nevertheless has a fervent — dare we say rabid? — following and a haunting title song by the Tindersticks. (The movies start at 12:15 a.m. Saturday and Sunday, but Nitehawk recommended arriving by 11:45 p.m. on Friday and Saturday for seating.) 136 Metropolitan Avenue, Brooklyn, 718-384-3980, nitehawkcinema.com. (Kenigsberg)‘Under the Cherry Moon’ (Friday and Saturday) Ever the renaissance man, Prince made his directorial debut in 1986 with this proudly personal approximation of a Depression-era musical — a choice of style and genre that, at the time, mostly left “Purple Rain” fans befuddled and dismissive. The musician stars as an American playboy on the French Riviera who, with his partner (Jerome Benton), conspires to fleece an heiress (Kristin Scott Thomas, in her first feature). The 35-millimeter print should do justice to Michael Ballhaus’s nostalgic black-and-white cinematography, not to mention the movie’s celebrated backbeat.

"‘WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS’ (PG-13, 1:47) John and Laura, the central couple in this lousy thriller, apparently don’t go to the movies much; if they did, they would know never to invite a third wheel into a bubble of domestic bliss because the crazed nanny/roommate/etc. is something of a cinematic trope. Eager to have a child, they strike an arrangement with a seemingly perfect young woman to be their surrogate mother. She grows more unbalanced as the pregnancy progresses, but none of it is suspenseful because it’s all so familiar. (Genzlinger)Film SeriesMODERN MATINEES: B IS FOR BOGART (through Oct. 28) Where was Rick before “Casablanca”? Although this Museum of Modern Art series features its share of quintessential Humphrey Bogart roles (like “The Maltese Falcon”), the programming highlights the star’s early turns, including his work with William Wyler (“Dead End”) and Raoul Walsh (“The Roaring Twenties,” “They Drive by Night,” “High Sierra”), with a particular emphasis on films in which he was typecast as a gangster. In “The Petrified Forest,” Mr. Bogart recreated his Broadway role as a murderous gang leader who hides out at a roadside diner in Arizona. Bette Davis works there and dreams of escaping to France; Leslie Howard is the hobo and would-be writer she falls for. Of all the rest stops in all the deserts in all the world, Bogart had to walk into theirs. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Ben Kenigsberg)BREAKING BARD: SHAKESPEARE ON FILM (through Monday) How can any Shakespeare-in-the-movies series not include a single film by Orson Welles, whose “Othello” and “Chimes at Midnight” are among the most visually dynamic and intellectual retellings of his work ever produced for the screen? But we may protest too much, at least when the other offerings are as enjoyable as Michael Almereyda’s contemporized “Hamlet,” which finds Ethan Hawke asking “to be or not to be?” in the Action section of a Blockbuster video-rental store, and Julie Taymor’s “Titus,” which treats “Titus Andronicus” with the bloody abandon it requires. And Richard Loncraine’s “Richard III” (Saturday), starring Ian McKellen as the hunchbacked royal schemer, remains one of the most fruitful modernizations, placing 15th-century political machinations in the context of 20th-century fascism.

Now the Museum of the Moving Image presents what it bills as the most complete American retrospective of the Polish director’s work. It opens with “The Double Life of Veronique,” which observes two women — Weronika in Poland and Veronique in France, both played by Irene Jacob — who seem to lead parallel lives, even though each one is unaware of the other. While “Dekalog” and Mr. Kieslowski’s celebrated “Three Colors” trilogy are also present, the series offers an opportunity to dive into some of the director’s early work, including documentary shorts he made between the 1960s and the 1980s. 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us.

First banned, then nearly lost after the Nazis attempted to destroy every copy, the movie is considered by many “the world’s first feature film to showcase sympathetic gay characters and themes,” Robert Ito wrote in The New York Times in 2013. It shows on 35 mm with live piano accompaniment in what is said to be the most complete version since the original release. At various locations; see newfest.org. (Kenigsberg)",movies
"Film Series‘PSYCHOMANIA’ AND ‘SCORPIO RISING’ (Monday) Instead of trick-or-treating, spend Halloween with bikers from hell. Light Industry’s inspired double feature pairs Don Sharp’s “Psychomania,” a cult film from 1973, with Kenneth Anger’s avant-garde landmark “Scorpio Rising” (1964). The first, also known as “The Death Wheelers,” stars Nicky Henson as Tom, the amoral leader of a gang of motorcyclists who terrorize unsuspecting English townsfolk. His mother (Beryl Reed) and her butler (George Sanders, in his last screen appearance) dabble in the dark arts, and Tom commits suicide believing that he will return from the dead. Sure enough, he does, with his drive for “Clockwork Orange”-style mayhem unencumbered by a fear of dying. Mr. Anger’s film spins a fantasia out of leather jackets, motorcycles, Hollywood iconography and pop tunes. At 7:30 p.m., 155 Freeman Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, lightindustry.org.

Other selections include “The Brat” (showing on a double bill Nov. 6 and 17), also from 1931, said to be the last of John Ford’s surviving sound films to be returned to availability; and “Behind the Door” (Nov. 20 and 21), an eerie World War I story from 1919 starring Hobart Bosworth as a German-American who is ostracized by his neighbors and ultimately goes off to sea with his wife in tow.

The programming includes five Japanese features — two animated (“Kiki’s Delivery Service,” “My Neighbor Totoro”) and at least one live-action cult favorite (“Hausu”) so demented and nonsensical that it might as well be. In terms of American fare, viewers will have to pick their favorite cat-woman: Simone Simon in the low-budget 1942 “Cat People” (Saturday), in which Jacques Tourneur relied on shadows to conjure atmosphere, or Nastassja Kinski in Paul Schrader’s 1982 remake (Saturday and Tuesday), a stylish, erotic thriller.

"‘DEKALOG’ (through Thursday) Made for Polish television, this celebrated mini-series by Krzysztof Kieslowski (the “Three Colors” trilogy) returns in a spruced-up version to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Mr. Kieslowski’s death. Each episode is inspired by one of the Ten Commandments, a conceit that the series observes with varying degrees of literalism. (The false idol in “Dekalog: One,” is a computer.) The episodes will screen in pairs for a week each. The most famous two, both with Hitchcockian premises, are in the middle of the run: “Dekalog: Five” crosscuts between an idealistic young lawyer as he takes a professional examination and the young man who will eventually become his client: a killer who murders without remorse and then is sentenced to death. “Dekalog: Six,” on the theme of not coveting thy neighbor’s wife, observes a shy postal worker who spies on a woman who lives in his housing complex.

(Kenigsberg)DESPERATE HOURS: THE FILMS OF MICHAEL CIMINO (through Thursday) When Michael Cimino died in July, appraisals tended to discuss his career in terms of what might have been. Soon after cementing his status as one of Hollywood’s hottest directors with the best picture Oscar for “The Deer Hunter” in 1979, he became an industry pariah following the cost overruns and critical savaging of “Heaven’s Gate” (1980). Time has gone some way toward reversing the verdict on those two films; it’s difficult to watch “Heaven’s Gate” today without admiring the scale of its ambition, the poetry of Christopher Walken’s violent entrance or the romantic sweep of Isabelle Huppert and Kris Kristofferson’s pas de deux. The Brooklyn Academy of Music’s retrospective takes the good with the bad; it includes Mr. Cimino’s work before “The Deer Hunter” (as a screenwriter on “Silent Running” and “Magnum Force,” the second “Dirty Harry” movie; as the director of “Thunderbolt and Lightfoot,” with Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges); and after “Heaven’s Gate.” Of those titles, “Year of the Dragon” (Saturday), from 1985, starring Mickey Rourke as a xenophobic cop in Chinatown, is probably the most commanding.

(Kenigsberg)‘GIANT’ AND JAMES DEAN (Friday through Thursday) Cal Trask, Jim Stark, Jett Rink: James Dean had only three credited movie roles, and yet even the character names seem chosen for their terse similarity, as if they were part of a grand plan. In George Stevens’s “Giant,” which turns 60 this year (and was released more than a year after Dean’s death in a car accident), the actor’s every twitch and gesture is riveting. He acts as a naturalistic Method counterweight to the hamminess of Rock Hudson, who plays a Texas rancher, and Elizabeth Taylor, as the Maryland woman who doesn’t know what she’s getting into when she marries him. Film Forum will also show the other two Dean features, “East of Eden” and his masterpiece, “Rebel Without a Cause,” throughout the week.

"Alamo Drafthouse445 Albee Square West, Downtown BrooklynWhat I Saw“Manchester by the Sea,” “Jackie”What I SippedA BrooklynThe Popcorn FileAlamo’s flagship theater in Austin inspired Nitehawk, and now Alamo has set up shop in Downtown Brooklyn — its 25th dine-in theater but its first in New York City. A pity about the location. You want to feel the cool Drafthouse vibe, but how can you when you have to navigate the stuff of sterile suburbia: a spotless mall in the City Point development, up the escalator to the fourth floor, past the Century 21 department store. Ah, but then you pass through the Alamo doors and there it is — the carpet straight out of “The Shining,” the charcoal wallpaper with its movie-projector pattern, the friendly hipster with the Brooklyn beard at the box office. I snapped a picture of my husband in front of a photographic mural of the city skyline, posed like King Kong on top of the Empire State Building, swatting at model airplanes. The Saturday matinee of the awards contender “Manchester by the Sea” was quiet, but enough of the luxe black leatherlike chairs were filled that I didn’t feel as if I was drinking my pre-noon cocktail alone. (The Brooklyn, a rye whiskey, dry vermouth, Amer Picon, orange and maraschino, is rated R on the menu.) The wild mushroom flatbread was tasty, but a New England clam chowder was on offer if you wanted to feel as one with the film’s star, Casey Affleck. I demurred. I returned a week later for “Jackie,” and was charmed and moved by the package of preshow films, which included a newsreel of Jacqueline Kennedy water-skiing with John Glenn — “the astronaut and the first lady put on a dazzling show” — and another announcing Mrs. Kennedy’s delivery of a premature son, Patrick. Mr. Glenn had died three days before this screening, and the baby did not survive beyond a few days. By the time the clip from the Richard Harris-Vanessa Redgrave “Camelot” played, the tears flowed freely and the glass was empty. I ordered the pancetta-and-leek mac and cheese, and the fried pickles, both good. In addition to its first-run fare, the Alamo Drafthouse programing includes repertory genre series like Girlie Night, Terror Tuesday and Weird Wednesday, all imported from Austin.iPic Fulton Market11 Fulton Street, Lower ManhattanWhat I Saw“Rogue One: A Star Wars Story”What I SippedTuck Old-FashionedThe Popcorn FileThis luxury multiplex has the opposite ambience of a Nitehawk or a Metrograph, but what do you want from the South Street Seaport. Hello, sailor. The Vegas-meets-Flintstones aesthetic is not for everyone. I found it quite cozy in the Premium Plus orange recliners, which come with a blanket and pillow — very handy for my snooze through “Rogue One.” The ticket cost $28, which included the popcorn but not the lobster roll (delicious at $21) or the cocktail (a bit sweet). Here you press a button on your swiveling seat table to order food, and the waiter arrives to take your order orally rather than via the scribbled slips of paper you use at Nitehawk, Alamo and Syndicated. To use the restroom you must go up the escalator and through the Tuck Room restaurant, which services the theater. It’s hard to say what was more distracting: the pulsing beat of the Tuck music or the translucent stall doors in the ladies room through which you could see the shadowy forms of fellow moviegoers, possibly looking for the absent toilet paper.",movies
"More current fare includes “Smashed,” an indie from 2012 with Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Aaron Paul, and the occasionally terrifying “Flight” from the same year, which melds the alcoholism drama with the near disaster pic, focusing on an airline pilot played by Denzel Washington. “Krisha,” last year’s much-praised indie in which a raging drunken aunt gives her family a super-memorable Thanksgiving, is available free to Prime members. I didn’t care for it — but I loved the rentable “Sideways,” the 2004 film directed by Alexander Payne about two friends’ ill-starred journeys in California wine country.Netflix seems a little thin on instructive or inspiring fare with respect to the adverse effects of booze, although it seems to teem with cheesy, borderline-creepy soft-core variants on “The Hangover,” which could be appropriate if you’re spending New Year’s Day determined to continue behaving badly.Cinephilia-inclined services offer strong stuff from strong directors. John Cassavetes was a maestro with boozers, although you couldn’t say that alcoholism per se was a central theme of his films. Nonetheless, “Faces” (1968), “A Woman Under the Influence” (1974) and “Opening Night” (1977), all viewable on Filmstruck, depict with painful clarity the messes one can make by drinking. “Days of Wine and Roses” is a remarkably tough-minded film for Hollywood in 1962, but that’s the director Blake Edwards for you. Nonalcoholics watch it and think, “So sad about Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick”; alcoholics in 12-step programs watch it and think, “Damn, why can’t I have Jack Klugman as my sponsor?” The movie is on the Warner Archive site, as is “The Helen Morgan Story,” a 1957 picture with Ann Blyth as Morgan, the singer who catapulted to fame in Broadway’s “Show Boat” and fell hard for the hard stuff. A young Paul Newman is the cad who takes advantage of her condition.I know, I know — where’s the “That Wasn’t So Bad” stuff? There’s not a lot of it, and much of it is, well, loud and empty, like the films of the “Hangover” franchise, which Amazon has up for rental or purchase. From the first film in 2009 to “The Hangover Part III” in 2013, the movies implicitly argue that alcohol, despite some of its deleterious effects, is the greatest male-bonding elixir out there. The second installment finds one of its characters blacking out and hooking up with a beautiful transgender prostitute in Bangkok; later, toasting his enablers at his wedding, he invokes the franchise’s “wolf pack” premise as his new wife stands there, presumably in the dark about his infidelity. Nice. The genial 2008 indie “Bottle Shock,” free on Amazon Prime, is a paean to connoisseurship, depicting in fiction form the rise of California wines in the 1970s.Finally, there is “The Thin Man,” from 1934, which reassures its audience that characters played by William Powell and Myrna Loy can imbibe their own weight in gin and still remain as charming and good-looking as William Powell and Myrna Loy. The movie has other virtues as well. It is for rent or purchase on Amazon. Here’s to your health, which will improve if you take a break from the sauce.",movies

"DARGIS That reminds me of a line in Wim Wenders’s 1976 film, “Kings of the Road”: “The Yanks have colonized our subconscious!” It’s a brilliant observation about the pervasiveness — for better, for worse — of American pop culture, including its cinema. I guess we need to amend that line for Life Under Disney. Except that these days, the major studios, all multinationals, rarely release movies that could inspire new generations of filmmakers at home and abroad or the kinds of arguments that ran through some of the greatest films of the 20th century.This isn’t the end of American cultural imperialism, mind you; I’m just noting that these studio movies seem increasingly irrelevant in every way except financially. Disney gobbled up 26.4 percent of the 2016 box office with just over a dozen movies, most conceived to sell one thing: Disney. True, some disseminate a few ideas, including niceness — a smiley-face ethos that extends to what might be called diversity lite.Today’s corporate cinema doesn’t speak to, and lie about, the United States and its values the way that the old Hollywood did, perhaps because we know better or are more cynical or because it’s hard to know what the country stands for now. Once, the movies could pretend that all men are created equal (as long as they’re white) and that good guys win (as long as they’re white guys), even as offscreen life made a lie of those fantasies. This corporate cinema doesn’t sell an idea of a nation and its ideals; it sells brands and products, and the little diversity it provides onscreen often tends to feel like an extension of its brand. So it will be interesting to see how Ms. DuVernay, a strong voice for inclusion, does with her next movie, “A Wrinkle in Time,” which she’s directing for … Disney!SCOTT For a lot of 2016, it seemed as if the dominant story was going to be about what, for want of a better word, is often called diversity, meaning the often frustrated, sometimes partly successful struggles of filmmakers who are not white men to work within a system that remains rigged against them.DARGIS In one significantly fraught way, the 2016 movie year began in earnest in February with the re-emergence of #OscarsSoWhite after the all-white slate of acting nominees was announced. Other objections surfaced over “Doctor Strange” and the casting of Tilda Swinton in a role that had been an Asian stereotype in the original comic. “Gods of Egypt,” “Ghost in the Shell,” “The Great Wall” — each month brought new argument and more protest. But the year also brought us excellent films from black directors working outside the studios, including “Moonlight,” “13th,” “O.J.: Made in America” and “I Am Not Your Negro.” The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences also diversified its membership — and ended lifelong voting rights, inspiring accusations of ageism.",movies

That description only suggests the bizarre dimensions of this chilly dystopia, which Lanthimos realizes with the deadpan wit of his 2010 breakthrough, “Dogtooth,” and with a surprising depth of feeling, courtesy of soulful performances by Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz.

Florence screeching her way through training sessions is a comic delight — as much for Simon Helberg’s chagrined pianist as for Streep’s charming obliviousness — but the film is also a touching affirmation of artistic expression.

"PhotoFRANK BRUNI: As Op-Ed columnists venturing boldly — or maybe I should say indulgently — into the world of movies, Ross, you and I sometimes labor to draw connections between politics and Hollywood.This time around, no such huffing and puffing are necessary, because the fall is upon us, and that’s when the most ambitious and topical fare comes out, in preparation for awards season. One of the new releases this past weekend, “Beasts of No Nation,” focuses on nothing less somber than child soldiers in war-torn African countries.We’re a long way from the dippy rom-coms of summer.Let’s begin on Mars, where Matt Damon is creating his own private Idaho and tilling spuds to stave off starvation. I’m describing the first stretch of “The Martian,” a movie that I experienced not just as thrilling entertainment but as a sort of corrective for the presidential campaign and our sour national mood.If I didn’t know how long it takes a movie to gestate, I’d think that “The Martian,” directed by Ridley Scott, had been ordered up in response to the pessimism espoused by Republican candidates in particular.Donald Trump keeps telling us what losers we’ve become. His rivals are less blunt but equally gloomy.ROSS DOUTHAT: Hey, wait — isn’t the whole point of Trump’s campaign that we can make America great again, that we can start doing the big things that we once took for granted (winning wars, launching manned space missions, building white-elephant casinos in Atlantic City … well, O.K., maybe just the first two) if we have only the wisdom and courage to elect the Donald as our leader? Obviously “The Martian” is set near the end of President Trump’s second (or maybe third?) term, after all earthbound enemies (the Islamic State, the Chinese, the Mexican government) have been vanquished, and we’re ready to look heavenward again.BRUNI: Did I hear that right: Two terms of Trump?!? I don’t think I — or the country — could survive that, and a movie set in such circumstances would look more like “I Am Legend” or “The Road,” by which I mean post-apocalyptic. In any case, my point is that the dire voices of Trump and his Republican rivals reflect an electorate in which parents don’t foresee a better life for their children and a significant majority of people think that America is on the wrong track.“The Martian,” in contrast, is a paean to American ingenuity, resilience and speed. In real life, we can’t manage to repair bridges or upgrade our infrastructure despite decades of justifiable angst about it. In Scott’s fantasy, we assemble sophisticated rockets in what seems like one sleepless, industrious week.DOUTHAT: Wasn’t it George W. Bush who last proposed a Mars mission?BRUNI: That was before Republicans became as fond of pooh-poohing science as they are now. In Scott’s fantasy, science saves the day. Bitter international rivalries crumble. And there’s a seamless integration of races and sexes. The brainy whiz kid with the eureka solution is black. The leader of a crew of astronauts is a woman.PhotoDOUTHAT: All political kidding aside, I think I’m in the minority in being slightly disappointed with Ridley Scott’s Mars movie. I loved the first third, when it’s all Matt Damon manifesting all-American ingenuity on Mars, and I liked the second third well enough, when the action moves to the multiracial band of NASA engineers and whiz kids. But then the movie started to actively bore me just when it should have been moving to its climax: The crew that turned back to rescue Damon’s astronaut was basically a human-interest-free zone (notwithstanding the fine actors playing them), and everything that happened along the way to the rescue felt predictable and even a little bit mailed-in.I appreciated that the movie didn’t weigh Damon’s character down with tearjerking personal baggage when it was just him mucking about cheerfully on Mars. But once we were supposed to become deeply invested in his rescue, I found myself pining for the primal emotional manipulations of “Apollo 13” or “Gravity” — or maybe I just wanted him to stay on Mars, to see exactly how long he could actually hold out.BRUNI: You can have your “primal emotional manipulations.” Give me vintage disco music! “The Martian” blares Gloria Gaynor across the galaxy, presenting science fiction you can dance to. Take comfort, Ross. We will survive.DOUTHAT: With all that said, I vastly preferred the way “The Martian” approached American creativity than the approach Aaron Sorkin and Danny Boyle took with their vision of Apple’s presiding genius in “Steve Jobs.” What did you think of Sorkin’s latest interpretation of our Silicon Valley overlords?BRUNI: It left me somewhat cold. I mean, I like the snap-crackle-pop of Sorkin dialogue as much as the next guy, and “Steve Jobs” is lousy with great actors, even if several of them (I’m thinking of Kate Winslet in particular) have been assigned notions rather than characters.DOUTHAT: Notions, in Winslet’s case, whose Polish accent slips in and out from scene to scene and time period to time period: She seemed to get more Polish between 1984 and 1998.PhotoBRUNI: I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a movie that wasn’t based on a play yet gives the impression of being an adaptation of one.DOUTHAT: I agree: Sorkin basically wrote a three-act play, and maybe the movie’s artifice would work better in the more artificial setting of a theater.BRUNI: “Steve Jobs” is claustrophobic, schematic, mannered, forced. I know its peculiar structure and scope are meant to feel daring, but that structure and scope are ultimately pressed into something a bit predictable and hokey: Jobs the visionary can’t savor his greatest triumph until Jobs the reluctant father reconnects with his soul, and vice versa.DOUTHAT: In a film that at least pretends to realism, the sheer absurdity of the premise — that 30 minutes before a major project launch Steve Jobs would let himself be assailed and harangued by friends, exes, bosses, children, and that the exact same group would show up to harangue him at two subsequent launches, years and decades later — wore me down, and quickly. (The fact that the characters had to keep acknowledging how absurd it was didn’t really help.)The irony is that the movie is probably technically truer to the real Jobs (even if Michael Fassbender never quite channeled his hippie/Zen side effectively) than “The Social Network” was to Mark Zuckerberg: The Facebook honcho isn’t really the status-obsessed, sexually frustrated monster of the meritocracy that Sorkin’s script made him out to be, whereas Jobs was really was an impossible perfectionist who treated the people around him terribly.But the fake Zuckerberg worked as a character; he had an internal logic, a set of motivations all-too-recognizable to anyone who’s survived the Ivy League. Whereas the real Jobs, in this movie, is trapped in airless set pieces and saddled with a totally unconvincing character arc. Only by becoming a better dad, a better man, could he become the man who gave us the iPhone … It’s a moral that feels as fake as the movie’s entire three-act conceit.BRUNI: That said, there’s an aspect of “Steve Jobs” beyond the fleet, nimble dialogue and energetic performances that interests me, and that is its clear, vivid reminder that Jobs wasn’t an inventor, with blazing scientific epiphanies, so much as a marketer, with a maniacal focus on packaging, messaging, timing, style. Is America’s greatest talent the same as his great talent? And, in that sense, is he as iconic and definitive an American character as any other?DOUTHAT: I always saw Jobs primarily as an aesthete, elevating an entire industry with his perfectionism, and selling the future by making it seem beautiful again. But of course you’re right that the “selling” was as crucial as the tastemaking: His genius wasn’t just in seeing that aesthetics mattered in computing; it was persuading everyone else to pay, and pay a premium, for the privilege of enjoying them.And speaking of interesting aesthetics, what did you think of “Beasts of No Nation,” a movie that takes us about as far from a Silicon Valley product launch as it’s possible to go? (Without going to Mars, that is.)BRUNI: There’s a scene in “Beasts” as gripping and devastating as any that has appeared or will appear in any movie this year, and it chills me even now, as I remember it. An African boy who has been separated from his family, utterly abandoned and swept up into a roving militia that’s his only hope for survival is instructed to show his fidelity and kill. He’s given a machete. He’s told how best to lower it, hard and swift, on the head of a man kneeling before him. The man trembles, weeps, begs. And in the interminable seconds — which feel like hours — before we, in the audience, see what happens, there’s the possibility that innocence can withstand corruption, that evil can be kept at bay.But here’s the thing about those seconds: You know they’re coming. You can telegraph the entirety of “Beasts” from its beginning. It has shocks but no real surprises, and the insights it provides into how violence begets violence, how tribalism blinds people to their common humanity, how thoroughly power intoxicates and how completely someone can objectify his or her enemies aren’t really insights: They’re what you already sense and expect.PhotoDOUTHAT: I wanted to love “Beasts.” It’s (obviously) worthy subject matter. It’s made by Cary Fukunaga, whose absence from the second season of “True Detective” revealed just how much his talents made the first. It’s Netflix’s first attempt at a feature film, and more companies making films — especially non-superhero films! — is always good. It stars the great Stringer Bell — I mean, the great Idris Elba. It starts out beautifully, in verdant domesticity tinged with mortal dread.But I agree: Past a certain point, its story just became a catalog of horrors, one nightmarish scene after another, crushing you with the human misery involved but never quite finding the thread of a compelling story.BRUNI: “Beasts” is a sometimes vivid illustration of the horrors that fill news stories, but it doesn’t dig deep enough to give you a truly fresh understanding of them. And there are long stretches in which it doesn’t really move forward or gather any additional force. Your stomach unclenches and your attention flags.DOUTHAT: This is a hard critique to offer, in a way, because of course many human situations are just a crushing sequence of horrors, and story is something imposed retrospectively, sometimes artificially, sometimes in ways that are quite untrue to the experience. But story is also a way in, a way for people outside the horrors to make the imaginative leap into what they’re witnessing. And I suppose I wanted Fukunaga to give me more of that assistance.BRUNI: Even Idris Elba’s initially riveting performance as the commander starts to fade in impact. You will not find a bigger Idris fan than I. I’d like to see him as the next James Bond. I’d like to see him in six movies a year. And if he winds up in the best supporting actor hunt for this movie, as is currently predicted, great. But that’s as much testament to the grimness and topicality of the subject matter of “Beasts” as to its artfulness.DOUTHAT: I thought his performance had all the terrifying charisma you could ask for. But I felt — strange as it sounds — like the script needed to make him a little bit more appealing, so that the spell that he casts on his boy soldiers could extend a little more, if only for a few scenes, to the audience as well. He’s just a little too unambiguously monstrous, which again I’m sure is true to life (the sexual abuse in particular), but which weakens the story’s pull on us: We’re watching his control over his boys be cemented and then come apart, and in the cementing process I wanted to have more moments when I almost, in spite of myself, liked him. Or failing that I wanted a clearer glimpse of his own tortured humanity, somewhere beneath the monstrous surface.Without it, “Beasts of No Nation” felt like an exercise in bearing witness: A good thing in its own right, but not enough to call the film a great work of art.BRUNI: It’s Oscar bait through and through.",movies
"THE HATEFUL EIGHT Quentin Tarantino sticks with mid-19th-century America (as with “Django Unchained”) in this drama set in Wyoming shortly after the Civil War. Kurt Russell stars as a bounty hunter headed for the town of Red Rock with his fugitive prize (Jennifer Jason Leigh). A winter storm and their encounters with tough guys (Samuel L. Jackson, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Walton Goggins and Bruce Dern) don’t bode well for a timely arrival or the service of justice. Not even at a stagecoach stop called Minnie’s Haberdashery.JOY When David O. Russell has directed Jennifer Lawrence before (“American Hustle,” “Silver Linings Playbook”), the results have been impressive. This time, Ms. Lawrence plays a character partly inspired by Joy Mangano, a real-life designer, inventor and entrepreneur whose best sellers have included space-saving clothes hangers and a mop that can be wrung without getting anyone’s hands wet. A four-generation family saga, this comedy-drama hybrid also stars the previous Russell-Lawrence collaborators Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper.POINT BREAK It’s been 24 years since Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), a young F.B.I. agent, went searching for a group of surfers who were actually bank robbers. That was Kathryn Bigelow’s action adventure. In this remake, the bad guys could be all kinds of extreme athletes — snowboarders and motorcyclists as well as surfers — and Luke Bracey, a young Australian actor, is Johnny Utah. With Edgar Ramirez and Delroy Lindo. Ericson Core directed.THE REVENANT Alejandro G. Iñárritu follows up his best-director Oscar win for “Birdman” with this action-adventure starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Mr. DiCaprio plays an American hunter who is left for dead in the wilderness but fights to survive and to get even with the man (Tom Hardy) who did this to him. With Domhnall Gleeson and Lukas Haas.YELLOW DAY Religious visions, miracles and a search for a lost love.

"13. Even Better In October, The Los Angeles Times reported that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was investigating gender discrimination in the industry, just as the American Civil Liberties Union requested state and federal agencies do after it conducted its own inquiry.14. On the Other Hand Here is an estimate of the movies directed by women that were released by major studios this year: Warner Bros. (five! — Lana Wachowski, Anne Fletcher, Dana Nachman, Nancy Meyers, Patricia Riggen); Universal (three — Sam Taylor Johnson, Elizabeth Banks, Angelina Jolie); Disney (one — Niki Caro); Paramount (0); Fox (0); and Sony (0). (I excluded Fox and Sony’s specialty units.)15. An Amazing Coincidence One of the studios with the most on-screen diversity — it released “Trainwreck” and “Straight Outta Compton” (if also “Ted 2”) — and with some of the most female directors is Universal, which, as of early December, had gobbled up almost 24 percent of the year’s market share.16. Most Ignored Truism “There’s a myth in the business that young males drive the box office,” Tom Rothman, the chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment’s motion picture group, told The Hollywood Reporter in November. In this same interview, Alan F. Horn, the chairman of the Walt Disney Studios, tried to make it simple: “There are variables that do affect what one pays any performer. Angelina Jolie, for example, got a lot more money for ‘Maleficent’ than Daisy Ridley did for ‘Star Wars,’ but they’re both women.” (Gee, thanks, Alan!)17. Most Complex Hurdle As of Dec. 7, seven out of 20 domestic top-grossing movies released this year had female-driven stories, according to the website Box Office Mojo. By contrast, five out of 20 female-driven stories topped the international market, which accounts for some 70 percent of the industry’s revenue. This may look bad, but the numbers appear marginally better than they have in recent years.18. Most Interesting Apology (tie) On Nov. 18, The Hollywood Reporter disgorged a 1,200-plus word apology for not including any nonwhite performer in its Oscar actress round table. Soon after, the director Alex Proyas and Lionsgate apologized for the lack of diversity in the cast in their new movie “Gods of Egypt.”",movies

"Film 101: Canon Fodder (Friday through Sunday) This enterprising brunch series would warrant mention just for the shameless subtitle, but the films are pretty nifty, too. IFC Center continues its efforts to expose high school students to some of the greats – complete with free admission and free popcorn at some showings. This weekend’s offering is Federico Fellini’s “8 ½.” (The series continues through Dec. 27.) At 11 a.m., 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village; 212-924-7771, ifccenter.com. (Grode)Imitations of Life: The Films of Douglas Sirk (Wednesday through Jan. 6) War dramas, Ibsen and Chekhov adaptations, caper films, 3-D westerns: There’s a lot more to the oeuvre of Douglas Sirk than sumptuously shot weepies, as this 25-film retrospective (Sirk’s largest in decades) makes clear. It starts well before the Eisenhower-era dissections for which he is best known, with a handful of German 1930s silents that he made when he was still known as Detlef Sierck. But fans of Rock Hudson in Technicolor needn’t worry: Thursday’s schedule alone includes “Magnificent Obsession,” “All That Heaven Allows” and “Written on the Wind.” Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, 212-875-5601, filmlinc.com. (Grode)Italian Film, 21st-Century Style: A Tribute to Rai Cinema (through Friday) This Museum of Modern Art’s 10-film tribute to the respected studio Rai Cinema concludes with Gianni Amelio’s 2004 movie “Le Chiavi di Casa (The Keys to the House).” At 4 p.m., MoMA Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Grode)‘It’s a Wonderful Life’ (Friday through Dec. 25) Whether it’s Nitehawk Cinema showing the infamous slasher film “Silent Night, Deadly Night” or IFC Center showing “Die Hard,” area theaters have a hard time resisting a splash of arsenic in their holiday eggnog. (“Now I have a machine gun/Ho-ho-ho.”) But IFC Center tries to be nice as well as naughty, returning each year with a 35mm print of this machine-gun-free 1946 classic. Also returning is Donna Reed’s daughter Mary Owen, who will appear before showings four days this week; a portion of ticket sales from those shows will support the Donna Reed Foundation for the Performing Arts. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-924-7771, ifccenter.com. (Grode)Lonely Places: Film Noir and the American Landscape (through Sunday) You can’t really have film noir without the “noir” part, right? All those ominous assignations and foreboding clouds of cigarette smoke just wouldn’t be the same in the daytime. Well, this intriguing Museum of the Moving Image retrospective tests this notion with 15 films set everywhere from Chuckwalla, Nev., (“Desert Fury”) to wintry upstate New York (“On Dangerous Ground,” Friday and Sunday). But as this series makes clear, the streets can be plenty mean way out in the swamps or the mountains or even the Technicolor desert. 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us/films. (Grode)Lynch/Rivette (through Tuesday) Film Society of Lincoln Center swings for the curatorial fences here, looking to point out the similarities between two hugely influential filmmakers – the American surrealist David Lynch and the French New Wave paterfamilias Jacques Rivette – in a series of seven double bills. Some pairings seem more natural than others: Saturday’s grouping of “Celine and Julie Go Boating” and “Mulholland Drive” splinters reality and performance in deliciously complementary ways, while last Sunday’s conjoining of the gonzo road movie “Wild at Heart” with the intensely claustrophobic “L’Amour Fou” seems like less of a neat fit. But perhaps those are the very dots that this series – programmed by Dennis Lim, the author of the new book “David Lynch: The Man From Another Place,” and Dan Sullivan — exists to connect. Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, 212-875-5601, filmlinc.com. (Grode)‘Pierrot le Fou’ (Friday through Thursday) When Jean-Luc Godard ran into trouble on his earlier films — not an uncommon scenario, given his seat-of-the-pants directing style — he often asked himself what Hitchcock would do. This 1965 lovers-on-the-run caper was the first time, he said, when Hitch’s imagined advice was of no use to him. As an absurdly glamorous Anna Karina and Jean-Paul Belmondo connive and rob their way to the South of France, the result is both unlike any other movie and oddly similar to 10,000 other movies. Chantal Akerman saw “Pierrot” at age 15 and instantly decided to become a filmmaker; perhaps Film Forum’s 50th-anniversary restoration will spur future stymied filmmakers to ask themselves what Godard would do.

"The Complete Studio Ghibli (Friday through Dec. 31) IFC Center’s retrospective of the complete works of Studio Ghibli, the beloved Japanese animation house, varies from the wistful and pleasant, like Hayao Miyazaki’s “My Neighbor Totoro,” to the crushingly sad, like Isao Takahata’s “Grave of the Fireflies,” about the alienation of childhood, set in Kobe during the end of World War II. (Most films will be offered with either subtitles or in English, or both.) It all leads up to Jan. 1, when “Only Yesterday,” released in Japan in 1991, will have its United States theatrical premiere. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-924-7771, ifccenter.com. (Alec M. Priester)Consequences (through next Friday) Truth be told, this overarching theme for the Rubin Museum of Art’s Cabaret Cinema series is fairly accommodating. With the occasional exception of the Coen brothers at their most fatalistic, what other filmmaker would claim that his or her on-screen actions have no reactions? Still, the museum (which has an accompanying series of public talks about karma) has assembled some fairly instructive examples. Upcoming offerings are “The Fountainhead” (Friday) and “Prince of the Himalayas” (Dec. 18). At 9:30 p.m., 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, 212-620-5000, rubinmuseum.org. (Grode)‘Dangerous Men’ (Friday and Saturday) After 26 years of toiling away on this jaw-dropper, the director-writer-producer-editor-composer John Rad didn’t live to see it have a proper release. (He paid out of his own pocket to place it in four Los Angeles theaters for a week in 2005. The four locations generated a combined $70 in ticket sales.) Actually, there’s nothing “proper” about the film, which includes a steak knife hidden in a woman’s intergluteal cleft and an albino drug kingpin named Black Pepper. But if midnight had never been invented as a temporal construct, let alone as a time to show movies, “Dangerous Men” would have forced its creation. It is that bad/good/baffling/amazing. Nitehawk Cinema, 136 Metropolitan Avenue, near Berry Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-384-3980, nitehawkcinema.com. (Grode)Film 101: Canon Fodder (through Dec. 27) This enterprising brunch series would warrant mention just for the shameless subtitle, but the films are pretty nifty, too. IFC Center continues its efforts to expose high school students to some of the greats – complete with free admission and free popcorn at some showings. Coming offerings include “The Rules of the Game” (Dec. 11 through 13) and “Citizen Kane” (Dec. 25 through 27). 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village; 212-924-7771, ifccenter.com. (Grode)Italian Film, 21st-Century Style: A Tribute to Rai Cinema (through next Friday) Fresh on the heels of its Antonio Pietrangeli retrospective, the Museum of Modern Art shifts its attention to 10 more recent Italian films, each of them from the respected studio Rai Cinema. These range from the quietly devastating (“The Son’s Room”) to the panoramically devastating (“Gomorrah”) and include such critical hits as Marco Bellocchio’s “Good Morning, Night” and Paolo and Vittorio Taviani’s “Caesar Must Die.” In addition to “Gomorrah,” Matteo Garrone will also be represented by the berserk “Tale of Tales,” in which Salma Hayek eats the giant heart of a sea monster and Toby Jones falls in love with a no less giant flea. MoMA Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 212-708-9400, moma.org. (Grode)Lonely Places: Film Noir and the American Landscape (through Dec. 20) You can’t really have film noir without the “noir” part, right? All those ominous assignations and foreboding clouds of cigarette smoke just wouldn’t be the same in the daytime. Well, this intriguing Museum of the Moving Image retrospective tests this notion with 15 films set everywhere from Chuckwalla, Nev., (“Desert Fury”) to wintry upstate New York (“On Dangerous Ground,” Dec. 18 and 20). But as this series makes clear, the streets can be plenty mean way out in the swamps or the mountains or even the Technicolor desert. 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us.

"Happy Birthday, Mr. Lewis: The Kid Turns 90 (Tuesday through March 15) Whether you regard Jerry Lewis as a comic genius or suspect that his appeal to the French must derive from the way his voice has been dubbed abroad, the Museum of Modern Art is celebrating his 90th birthday with a full-throated defense of his artistry. The series includes six films directed by the former animator Frank Tashlin, whom Mr. Lewis has credited as an inspiration for the cartoon visual sense he has employed as a filmmaker, and another six directed by Mr. Lewis himself. On opening night, the museum will screen a rare cut of his second directorial feature, “The Ladies Man” (Tuesday and March 10). Mr. Lewis plays a recent college graduate who moves into an all-female boardinghouse (and at one point dances a tango with George Raft). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 212-708-9400, moma.org/film. (Kenigsberg)Modern Matinees: A Pioneer Cowboy (Through Friday) Even in the 1910s, when stage-trained actors with unconventional looks could mosey their way onto the big screen more easily, William S. Hart and his melancholy woodcarving of a face cut a jarring figure. An acquaintance of Wyatt Earp and an accomplished Shakespearean actor on Broadway, Hart didn’t arrive in Hollywood until he was 49. He made up for lost time, appearing in more than 60 films in just over a decade. This Museum of Modern Art retrospective includes the boisterous 1916 Western “Hell’s Hinges,” in which Hart’s gunman sees the light when a preacher and his sister arrive in the titular territory, described in the film’s intertitles as “a gun-fighting, man-killing, devil’s den of iniquity that scorched even the sun-parched soil on which it stood.” On various days, a detailed schedule is at moma.org. (Eric Grode)Mysterious Splendors: Apichatpong Weerasethakul (Monday through March 10) Mr. Weerasethakul, known as Joe to his fans, achieved an international breakthrough in 2010 with “Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives,” the first Thai film to win the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. But this filmmaker’s penchants for relaxed jungle odysseys, fissuring narratives and unexpected appearances by talking monkeys hardly begin there. IFC Center is screening the best of his early features (including “Blissfully Yours,” “Tropical Malady” and “Syndromes and a Century”) before opening two newer works, the hourlong “Mekong Hotel” and the full-length “Cemetery of Splendor,” next Friday. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-924-7771, ifccenter.com. (Kenigsberg)‘Ran’ (Friday through Thursday) Akira Kurosawa’s last bona fide epic, from 1985, was not his first adaptation of Shakespeare: His great “Throne of Blood” put a samurai spin on “Macbeth,” while “The Bad Sleep Well” borrowed elements of “Hamlet.” But this 162-minute transposition of “King Lear” to feudal Japan is the only one of those films in color. The stark compositions and the wilds of nature contribute to this unusually visceral rendering of a warlord’s descent into madness. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, 212-727-8110, filmforum.org. (Kenigsberg)Manoel de Oliveira’s Tetralogy of Frustrated Love (Through Sunday) The Portuguese filmmaker Manoel de Oliveira’s reputation for longevity — he died last year at 106 — was matched only by his renown for autumnal productivity: More than a dozen of his features had their premieres after he turned 90. Yet it’s difficult to get a hold of the earlier movies that shaped him, including the four rarely screened adaptations in this series. Especially notable are “Francisca” (1981, showing Sunday), a story of 19th-century romantic treachery that achieves a fascinating tension in the contrast between Mr. Oliveira’s burnished imagery and his actors’ flat, declamatory style, and “Doomed Love” (1979, Friday and Saturday), a tale of star-crossed lovers that flaunts its stagelike backdrops, chiaroscuro compositions and unconventional shooting and editing rhythms. In both movies, the modernist director pioneers a form of filmmaking that expresses a constant debt to prose, painting and theater. Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, 212-875-5601, filmlinc.com. (Kenigsberg)Witches’ Brew (Through Monday) A ready-made Halloween event that has somehow turned up in February, this witch-themed retrospective from the Brooklyn Academy of Music invites viewers to pick their poison: The program puts stylish Italian horror (“Suspiria”) alongside a Roald Dahl adaptation (“The Witches”) and the more spiritual, introspective work of Carl Theodor Dreyer (“Day of Wrath,” Monday). At various times, a full schedule is at bam.org. BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, 718-636-4100. (Kenigsberg)",movies
"Because of his poor health, Mr. Burton was unable to participate in the latest installment of the movie series, “Creed,” which was released in 2015 and focuses on Rocky’s role as trainer and mentor to the son of Apollo Creed. But Loretta Kelley, his sister, said that Mr. Burton’s picture is visible on a restaurant wall in one scene.Anthony Mabron Burton was born in Flint, Mich., on March 23, 1937.Ms. Kelley said she and others who were close to him called him by his middle name. He played football and baseball at Flint Northern High School and graduated in 1955.Mr. Burton started boxing as an amateur with the Golden Gloves organization, where he excelled. He won two Flint Golden Gloves light-heavyweight titles, in 1955 and 1957, then briefly fought professionally in the light-heavyweight division from 1958 to 1959 before retiring from the ring after a beloved coach died.He moved to Los Angeles, but drifted and later got in trouble with the law, eventually serving a three-year prison sentence for robbery. While in prison, he became interested in acting and took a vocational training course in radio and television repair.“It took a while, but your life prepares you for these roles,” Mr. Burton said in an interview with The Daily Breeze, a Torrance, Calif., newspaper, in 1988. “If I hadn’t been a fighter, I probably wouldn’t have gotten the ‘Rocky’ roles. If I hadn’t been in prison, maybe I wouldn’t have gotten all those prison roles.”",movies

"Orson Welles (through Feb. 3) How do you follow up directing, producing, co-writing and starring in the greatest film ever made, especially when you did that in your mid-20s? Film Forum is wasting no time celebrating the centenary of Orson Welles (1915-85), who spent the next 44 years after the release of “Citizen Kane” trying to figure out the answer to that question. (“Citizen Kane” kicked off this series.) Before-and-after versions of “Macbeth” (with dubbed voices!) and “Touch of Evil” show just how much the studio cuts differed from Welles’s; tragically, no such comparison is possible for “The Magnificent Ambersons,” a masterpiece even in its tampered form. Of particular note will be a Feb. 2 screening and reading of “Too Much Johnson,” a Mercury Theater production for which a pre-""Kane” Welles shot about 40 minutes of footage. The production never made it to New York, and the filmed material was believed to have been lost forever until it was found and preserved in 2013. Maybe there’s hope for an intact “Ambersons”? 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, 212-727-8110, filmforum.org; $13. (Grode)Shakespeare and the Jacobeans on Film (Sunday) Red Bull Theater has built a reputation in the last decade for its bruising, lucid takes on the Jacobean era that go well beyond that period’s favorite son, William Shakespeare. Following a talk this month on Shakespeare and his influence on the slightly younger John Ford, the theater is presenting screenings based on plays by the two men. First came Franco Zeffirelli’s lush 1968 adaptation of “Romeo and Juliet.” This weekend brings the little-known 1980 TV movie of Ford’s “'Tis Pity She’s a Whore,” which Red Bull will be staging Off Broadway in April. Roland Joffé directed that adaptation for the BBC just before his film career took off with “The Killing Fields,” which could just as easily describe Ford’s memorably grisly drama.

(Grode)‘A Thousand Suns’ and ‘Touki Bouki’ (through Tuesday) “Nothing is true and nothing is false.” That’s how the French actress and filmmaker Mati Diop describes her beguiling melds of fact and fiction in works like “A Thousand Suns” and her short “Atlantiques.” They will be screened together at this weeklong retrospective, along with the 1973 classic “Touki Bouki,” which recently made Sight & Sound magazine’s Top 100 list of films. “Touki Bouki” was directed by Ms. Diop’s uncle Djibril Diop Mambéty and starred the nonprofessional Senegalese actor Magaye Niang, whom she features in “A Thousand Suns.” Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 212-708-9400, moma.org.

But with almost 50 films and shorts, this festival can cast a fairly wide net. There’s also “The Zionist Idea,” which will be the source of a panel discussion on Sunday; “Forbidden Films,” about a collection of incendiary Nazi propaganda films and the controversy over whether they should be shown; and “The Outrageous Sophie Tucker,” a look at the vaudeville star. And don’t forget “The Go-Go Boys: The Inside Story of Cannon Films,” about the Israeli cousins and producers Menachem Golan and Yoram Globus who gave the world the likes of “Bolero” and, yes, “Breakin’ ” (and, to be fair, Jean-Luc Godard’s “King Lear”) in the 1980s. “Paris Is Burning” is part of a “Guest Selects” sidebar, organized by its director, Jennie Livingston, who has also programmed “Sophie’s Choice” and “Dr. Strangelove.” The festival is presented by the Jewish Museum and the Film Society of Lincoln Center.

"French Classics of the 1930s-40s (through Monday) By the beginning of the late 1950s, Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard and the rest of the New Wave had given up on French cinema, dismissing it as hopelessly stodgy and middlebrow compared with the works of such bare-knuckled Americans as Howard Hawks and Nicholas Ray. Anthology Film Archives tries to salvage a few reputations with this reminder that the old wave made some pretty big splashes, too. Of particular note, along with titles by Marcel Carné and Sacha Guitry, is Henri-Georges Clouzot’s “Le Corbeau,” which managed to infuriate both the right-wing Vichy press and the anti-Nazi resistance in 1943. (Clouzot was fired from the German production company two days before the film was released.) 32 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, 212-505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org. (Grode)John Carpenter: Master of Fear (Thursday through Feb. 22) Jonathan Lethem was asked a few years ago to write a book-length essay on any film he wanted, as long as he went “off-canon.” He chose “They Live,” John Carpenter’s whacked-out parable of Reagan-era conformity, with its six-minute fistfight and ambling, blues-tinged soundtrack. That score was composed by Mr. Carpenter, who did similar double duty on the pioneering horror film “Halloween,” the still harrowing “Assault on Precinct 13” and nearly every other one of his films. (His first solo album, “Lost Themes,” will be released on Tuesday.) BAMcinématek’s retrospective is being billed as complete, which means you can expect several other high points of Mr. Carpenter’s career (including the spectacularly grisly remake of “The Thing” and the atypically gentle “Starman”) alongside the likes of “Ghosts of Mars.” BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org.

Gordon Willis (Friday through March 1) This master cinematographer (1931-2014) may have worked his contrast-heavy magic on Staten Island (“The Godfather”), Brooklyn (“The Landlord”) and Manhattan (“Manhattan”), but he was born in Astoria, Queens. Those films will be shown at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, along with “Annie Hall” (Friday at 7 p.m.), “All the President’s Men” and more than a dozen other films. Willis’s parents were Broadway dancers, which makes the series’s final film, the gimlet-eyed musical “Pennies From Heaven,” a particularly apt coda to a thoroughly exciting tribute. “Pennies” may be set in Chicago, but Willis found room in it for tableaux vivants of New York paintings by Edward Hopper and Reginald Marsh. Willis once said of Hollywood, “I don’t think it suffers from an overabundance of good taste.” For almost 30 years, he did what he could to fix that. 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us.

Gritty, lucid Friedkin thrillers like “The French Connection” owe a serious debt to Costa-Gavras’s sublime “Z,” which pulses and seethes just as memorably now as it did 45 years ago. It’s a debt that Mr. Friedkin will presumably acknowledge in his 7 p.m. discussion before the film’s screening. 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, 718-636-4100, bam.org.

"Earlier this week, Frank Bruni and I steered our latest movies-and-politics dialogue into the open water between the Golden Globes and the Oscar nominations, wrangling a little over some of the holiday releases, particularly “American Sniper,” which neither of us loved but whose politics (or lack of politics) I was more inclined to defend, while finding a little bit more common ground in the great-“Selma”-and-historical-accuracy debate. That common ground was mildly critical of the way “Selma” so explicitly black-hats Lyndon Johnson, but now that the Oscar nominations are out and neither the movie’s director nor its star earned a nomination I wish I’d muted my criticism even more, because if accuracy issues peeled off any support from the film it’s a pretty terrible to reason to have Ana DuVernay and David Oyelowo lose out to — well, basically anyone associated “Foxcatcher,” “The Theory of Everything,” and “The Imitation Game,” all of which are based-on-true-story movies that are just as vulnerable as “Selma” to historical-inaccuracy critiques, and none of which (despite various strengths) feature directing or acting that equals the work that DuVernay and Oyelowo turned in.So everyone griping on the internet about how “Selma” was treated has a point … as do the people shocked (as I am) that “The Lego Movie” wasn’t even nominated for a Best Animated Film … as does everyone (well, me and Chris Orr, mostly) baffled by the Academy’s apparent allergy to J.C. Chandor, who has now made three consecutive Oscar-caliber movies (“Margin Call,” “All Is Lost” and “A Most Violent Year,” which I talked about a bit in conversation with Bruni) and has only a Best Original Screenplay nod to show for it.And then — well, look, I could go on, but we all know that the Oscars never really reward the best movies, and while it’s reasonable to get a little mad about them (because nominees and winners find wider audiences and reap larger returns than snubs) the best way to respond is to calmly point readers toward the real quality instead. So even though this a little late by the standard of “best of …” lists, below as counterprogramming are the top eleven movies not nominated for Best Picture in 2014, with links to my (paywalled) National Review reviews where they exist.*10 (tie). “The Hunger Games: Mockingjay: Part I” and “Guardians of the Galaxy”No, it’s not “Star Wars,” but “Guardians” was still the most original movie produced by the Marvel Machine in, well, quite some time. And the Hunger Games series is the best franchise Hollywood has going right now.9. “Gone Girl”I think Fincher is one of the great directors of the last two decades; I also think this was second-tier Fincher. But his second-tier work is still good.8. “Nightcrawler”Rancid, implausible, still gripping. Rene Russo should get more work.7. “Noah”Deeply weird, with some terrible choices (those Ent-angels), but gets better as it goes; a genuinely theologically fascinating (and defensible!) interpretation of the story.6. “The Lego Movie”Just a truly unexpected pleasure.5. “A Most Violent Year”Not Chandor’s best movie, but two-thirds of a great film, with Oscar Isaac (like Chandor repeatedly ignored by Academy voters, for this turn and for last year’s “Llewyn Davis”) delivering a performance that should vie with Oyelowo’s for the best male acting of the year.4. “Calvary”A bit stagey and schematized, and only the second best film with Catholic themes this year. But impressive nonetheless.3. “Interstellar”Flawed but majestic. If “Gravity” deserved a Best Picture nod (and it did) then so does this rather more inspiring vision of mankind in space.2. “Snowpiercer”Aesthetically thrilling, politically more complicated than you might expect, Tilda Swinton. Need I say more?1. “Ida”Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film. Deserves to win that award and more. The only truly great film I saw this year.Honorable mentions: “Under The Skin” and “Blue Ruin.” Extremely dishonorable mentions: “The Rover” and “The Judge.”Then for the record, the Best Picture nominees that definitely deserved their nominations were “Selma,” “The Grand Budapest Hotel,” “Birdman,” and “Boyhood.” I haven’t seen “Whiplash” (nominated) or “The Babadook” (not), but I’m guessing both would make this list as well. And even though I didn’t think his Stefan Zweig homage was quite at the level of “Moonrise Kingdom,” “Rushmore” or “Tenenbaums,” I’m currently kind of rooting for Wes Anderson to somehow sneak off with the prize, as his next chance probably won’t come around for another twenty years or so.",movies
"BELGRADE, Serbia — At the end of November, a group of young Serbian artists and activists burst into an abandoned cinema in Belgrade called Zvezda. The theater was to be demolished, and the “Movement for the Occupation of Cinemas” was determined to save it. Over six weeks later, they’re still there, putting on films and attracting worldwide attention for their stand — but also raising questions about what, exactly, cinema means in today’s society.Zvezda, whose name means “Star” in Serbian, isn’t just any theater. Before it was closed, it was one of the crowning symbols of the propulsive and world-famous Yugoslav film industry. For a time, in the 1960s, Serbian films, led by the so-called Black Wave movement, were some of the most provocative in the world, winning global acclaim for their use of experimental techniques to critique socialist society. International stars flocked to the country, including Richard Burton, Sophia Loren and Orson Welles. The former Yugoslavia was a country in love with the movies, whatever the genre. Josip Broz Tito himself reportedly watched almost 9,000 movies between 1949 and his death in 1980, about 285 a year (he was partial to American Westerns, especially ones starring John Wayne).But while Serbians still go to the movies, the notion of a vibrant national film culture is in the distant past, brought low by the post-socialist, post-Balkan war wave of privatization and globalization of the 2000s. State-owned companies were privatized pell-mell; a Serbian businessman bought 14 cinemas of the once-famous Belgrade Film chain, worth an estimated $80 million, for about $10 million. Most of these and other theaters were converted into more profitable operations like supermarkets, restaurants and nightclubs. Not only did the privatization process transform old-style cinemas into modern multiplexes, but the whole logic of the profit-oriented ideology turned culture into just another commodity.When it looked as if the same fate was about to befall the old Zvezda, the artists and activists got moving. Along with screening classic and new movies — including a short film made in support of the occupation by the French director Michel Gondry — the occupiers have used the theater to highlight the painful consequences for culture and civic society of an economy built on austerity and profit above all else.",movies
"There is something more that draws me to TCM’s old stuff. Those films have an integrity that most of today’s films almost always lack. The integrity is physical; it is owed to the certainty that no computer interfered with anything. We like to refer to the illusion of the movies, but the illusion in those movies was less illusory. The people in them did what they were filmed doing. When the side of the house falls on Buster Keaton and he stands, miraculously, in the empty square of its missing window, the side of the house actually fell on him. (It is said that some people left the set that day because they could not bear to watch.)Now they would green-screen him and add the phony danger later. You cannot confidently believe in the spatial or pictorial authenticity of movies anymore because they are digitally fixed and technologically rigged. The slick new resources, which take vividness way beyond verisimilitude, are a boon for entertainment; but when you see the finished product you can smell the green screen, the way you can smell Google in pieces written by people who do not really know their subject. (I once had the strange pleasure of acting — though that is too grand a term for what I turned in — against a green screen. It was extremely disorienting, trying to suggest a narrative context in a setting of total decontextualization.) The old movies owe their power partly to the limited technical resources that were available to the people who made them. Their artifice was truer. Their fictions seemed less fictive. For the most special effects of all are the effects of no effects.If watching old movies is a form of escapism, it is at least not an escape from the human world. It is, in fact, an escape to the human world. When your own corner of the universe is hard or grim, there is dignity in escape. Yet anything that enhances your sense of reality and renovates your sense of possibility cannot be denigrated as “mere” escapism. We watch movies because life must be faced.",movies
"Film Comment Selects (through Thursday) Film Comment magazine, with its thinking cap on and its elbows out, can be counted on to settle a few cineaste arguments and kick up a few new ones. For the 15th edition of this agreeably eclectic festival, the magazine’s editors have unearthed an eye-catching roster of 29 titles. Among them are the under-seen 1975 Mike Nichols comedy, “The Fortune”; Christian Petzold’s devastating new World War II romantic drama, “Phoenix”; the self-explanatory “Electric Boogaloo: The Wild, Untold Story of Cannon Films,” complete with three choice 1980s offerings from that schlock-friendly studio; and Larry Clark’s latest round of prurience, “The Smell of Us,” which could be called “ ‘Kids’ Goes to Paris.” Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center, 144 West 65th Street, and Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street; 212-875-5601, filmlinc.com. (Grode)D.W. Griffith (Monday through April 27) This year is the centennial of Ingrid Bergman, Arthur Miller, Frank Sinatra and, according to a recent New York magazine article, the feature film. This last, factually debatable distinction referred to the 1915 release of the Ku Klux Klan paean “The Birth of a Nation,” which remains as pioneering and as indefensible as ever. Don Perry, the writer and director of last year’s keen-eyed documentary “Through a Lens Darkly,” will presumably try to address both sides of this during his introduction of the film on Monday at 7:40 p.m. It kicks off a nine-week series of Monday screenings dedicated to D.W. Griffith, whose innovations can be seen in virtually every film to follow in his virtuosic wake. The coming weeks will feature Griffith’s no less ambitious “Intolerance,” the most expensive film made at that time; the W.C. Fields vehicle “Sally of the Sawdust,” for those who prefer their hatred in sunnier form; and “Way Down East,” with its white-knuckle chase across real-life ice floes.

Gordon Willis (through Sunday) This master cinematographer (1931-2014) may have worked his contrast-heavy magic on Staten Island (“The Godfather”), Brooklyn (“The Landlord”) and Manhattan (“Manhattan”), but he was born in Astoria, Queens. Those films will be shown at the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, along with “Annie Hall,” “All the President’s Men” and more than a dozen other films. Willis’s parents were Broadway dancers, which makes the series’s final film, the gimlet-eyed musical “Pennies From Heaven,” a particularly apt coda to a thoroughly exciting tribute. “Pennies” may be set in Chicago, but Willis found room in it for tableaux vivants of New York paintings by Edward Hopper and Reginald Marsh. Willis once said of Hollywood, “I don’t think it suffers from an overabundance of good taste.” For almost 30 years, he did what he could to fix that. 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, 718-784-0077, movingimage.us.

But Wim Wenders also knows how to tell stories — sad, atmospheric, austere stories — with the best of them. Fresh off receiving a lifetime achievement award at the Berlin International Film Festival, Mr. Wenders will introduce several of the opening week’s titles. On Wednesday at 7 p.m., he will take part in a conversation with his frequent collaborator Peter Handke, who had a hand in writing dialogue for wistful angels (“Wings of Desire,” screening on Thursday), nihilistic soccer players (“The Goalie’s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,” on Wednesday at 7 p.m.) and just about everyone in between.

"‘The Best of Egg the Arts Show’ (Tuesday) IFC Center’s Stranger Than Fiction documentary series takes an unexpected detour into TV land with this retrospective of the much-missed PBS documentary series, which tackled some delightfully outré topics (The Times’s Michael Kimmelman on conceptual art, Reverend Billy’s anticorporate performances, even a master bow maker as he works with a Cleveland Orchestra violinist) from 2000 to 2003. The lineup is still being finalized, but at least for one night, culture vultures needn’t flip to their PBS station at 2:30 a.m. with their fingers crossed. The show’s creators, Jeff Folmsbee and Mark Mannucci, will take part in a Q. and A. after the screening.

(The films screen at midnight each weekend.) Even Mr. Cronenberg’s recent swerves into studio fare (“A History of Violence,” “Eastern Promises”) have shed surprisingly little of the perverse ambition that spurred him to tackle such seemingly unfilmable adaptations as “Naked Lunch” and “Crash.” Midnight staples like “Scanners” and “Videodrome” are obvious choices, and his 1986 remake of “The Fly” remains an unsurpassed combination of the romantic and the repulsive. The retrospective culminates with a screening of his latest film, “Maps to the Stars,” and the upstairs hallway will feature a collection of Mr. Cronenberg’s international movie posters throughout the run, including a doozy of a “Naked Lunch” poster from Japan. 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village, 212-924-7771, ifccenter.com. (Grode)‘The Grand Budapest Hotel’ (Thursday) When Matt Zoller Seitz finished his wonderful book-length exploration of Wes Anderson’s films, this melancholy masterpiece — currently nominated for nine Academy Awards — had not yet come out. So Mr. Seitz’s publisher took the unusual step of commissioning a slim follow-up volume devoted to it and only it. Will each of Mr. Anderson’s films get the same treatment? You can ask Mr. Seitz when he introduces the film to kick off Nitehawk Cinema’s new Booze & Books series. It will continue Feb. 24 with a screening of Robert Altman’s “3 Women,” introduced by the authors of the authorized visual biography “Altman.” 136 Metropolitan Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-384-3980, nitehawkcinema.com. (Grode)John Carpenter: Master of Fear (through Feb. 22) Jonathan Lethem was asked a few years ago to write a book-length essay on any film he wanted, as long as he went “off-canon.” He chose “They Live,” John Carpenter’s whacked-out parable of Reagan-era conformity, with its six-minute fistfight and ambling, blues-tinged soundtrack. That score was composed by Mr. Carpenter, who did similar double duty on the pioneering horror film “Halloween,” the still harrowing “Assault on Precinct 13” and nearly every other one of his films. (His first solo album, “Lost Themes,” was released on Feb. 3.) BAMcinématek’s retrospective is being billed as complete, which means you can expect several other high points of Mr. Carpenter’s career (including the spectacularly grisly remake of “The Thing” and the atypically gentle “Starman”) alongside the likes of “Ghosts of Mars.” BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100, bam.org.

All of his prestige pictures will be screened, along with the lurid H.G. Wells adaptation “Island of Lost Souls” and a film that Laughton directed, the unforgettable “The Night of the Hunter.” There’s also “The Epic That Never Was,” a documentary about the larger-than-life Laughton protagonist that got away: the Roman emperor Claudius, in an unfinished 1937 Josef von Sternberg film. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, 212-727-8110, filmforum.org.

"M.D. I didn’t see the movie that a lot of those latter-day critics saw: I saw a gravely unsettling, often anguished and angry movie about a man who becomes a cog in a war machine in the name of God and country, only to then be killed by that same machine. Much like Kathryn Bigelow did in her 2009 Iraq-war movie “The Hurt Locker,” Mr. Eastwood doesn’t directly engage with American politics and policies in “American Sniper.” In a way, “Sniper” affirms the sentiment that Ms. Bigelow opens her movie with by quoting from Mr. Hedges’s “War Is a Force”: “The rush of battle is a potent and often lethal addiction, for war is a drug.” The Kyle in “American Sniper” is in his way as addicted to war as the hero of “The Hurt Locker,” a bomb detonator.It’s instructive that the combat scenes in “American Sniper” are less thrilling than those in “The Hurt Locker.” Part of this is style — Mr. Eastwood is a Hollywood classicist with art-film tendencies — but the violence in “Sniper” brings you down rather than pumps you up. It’s tense, not thrilling. Another difference is that “American Sniper” is made by a Republican whose politics have been called out at least since Pauline Kael, among others, deployed the word fascism against “Dirty Harry,” the 1971 Don Siegel film that burnished Mr. Eastwood’s stardom. Harry is dirty, all right — he’s an exciting, repellent blunt instrument who lives by the gun, which also makes him quintessentially American. And part of what makes “Dirty Harry” so powerful is that, much like “Sniper,” it invites violently oppositional readings.Image Credit Mark Ralston/Agence France-Presse — Getty ImagesA.O.S. I don’t think it will shock you or our readers if I confess that my politics tend to be more liberal than not. But a lot of movies that conform to my own views bore me silly or drive me batty, and a lot of my favorite films and filmmakers come from ideological perspectives very different from my own. That’s why I like movies, and why I’d rather write about them than just about anything else. It’s not that movies don’t have political implications or (sometimes) effects, but that these are rarely as straightforward as they seem. A good movie is always more complicated than what it might be trying to say, and a popular movie will always have more than merely partisan appeal.It’s important to recall that before it broke box-office records in January, “American Sniper” did huge business in limited release in the deep-blue cities of Los Angeles and New York. The fact that it’s now hauling in “Harry Potter”- or “Hunger Games”-level money — that it’s a genuine blockbuster — suggests an appeal far broader than a particular voting bloc. Moviegoers are interested in the story, interested in Mr. Eastwood, and also interested in violence. Some may be troubled by what they see, others excited, others infuriated or consoled. As Oscar Wilde said, there are as many publics as there are personalities.",movies

"TrainwreckOpens July 17With Judd Apatow directing, Amy Schumer wrote and stars in this comedy about a promiscuous magazine writer forced to confront the real possibility of falling in love with Bill Hader’s character.NOTABLE SCENE Amy’s character seduces a male intern at her magazine only to be caught in bed by his mother, one of a number of cringe-inducing encounters.JUDD APATOW We just sat on the phone, and I asked Amy what her relationship issues were. Even though the story is fabricated, some details are taken from her life, and you can tell she’s not kidding. You root for her as a character because there’s honesty to it.AMY SCHUMER I was falling in love at the time, and I wrote about the things I was realizing about myself. I wasn’t looking to make a sex movie, whatever that means, but I’m 33, I’ve had sex with two dozen people and I’ve been dating, I’ve never been married, I’ve had boyfriends and lived with people, and it’s everything that comes with being a single girl in Manhattan. I’m sure people expected a certain level of sexual content from me because of the subject matter I deal with [in her stand-up], but sex is just part of my story. And it’s just such good fodder for comedy, because such ridiculous things happen when you have a sexual experience with someone new.APATOW Great sex is never funny. There’s nothing more awkward than sex gone wrong, so it’s always a comic device and one way we see how people are broken.SCHUMER I do think about what’s too much. There’s a scene where there’s a montage of guys leaving my apartment, and there was a time where we thought it would work to show from my point of view seeing different guys on top of me. And I said that was too graphic. I’m sure a lot of people think I’m just too much, but I’m going to be myself but still make it palatable for people.APATOW For a long time, most of these movies were written by men. Anytime you have a woman write and star [in] a movie, which is about her point of view, you’re going to get something much different and fresher. There are a lot of stories with that point of view that we’re just starting to get now, and we have people like Amy and Lena [Dunham] and Tina Fey and Mindy Kaling and other people who are coming up right now.SCHUMER It wasn’t a conscious decision to switch up the roles in terms of male and female power dynamics, but that’s just been my experience. I know men who are way more sensitive than a lot of the women I know.",movies
"‘Wild Tales’ (R, 1:54, in Spanish) As high-spirited as its title suggests, this anthology from the Argentine writer-director Damián Szifron offers up a scabrous, often unsettlingly funny look at human behavior in extremis. The best stories are as narratively stripped down as a Road Runner cartoon; they make worrying over ethics seem somehow self-indulgent. (Dargis)‘Woman in Gold’ (PG-13, 1:47) The movie rests heavily on the squared shoulders of Helen Mirren whose real-life character, Maria Altmann, is a proud, elderly Austrian Jewish woman struggling for the possession of a priceless Gustav Klimt painting stolen by the Nazis. Her performance salvages a film that without her, would be a laborious slog down a well-trodden path. (Holden)Film Series‘Beggars of Life’ (Monday) Even with a newsboy cap obscuring her signature bangs, Louise Brooks manages to captivate as an innocent woman on the lam in William Wellman’s train-hopping 1928 melodrama. (The title comes from a bit of noble-hobo philosophizing of the sort that Preston Sturges would mock years later in his own starlet-riding-the-rails-in-unconvincing-men’s-clothes effort, “Sullivan’s Travels.”) Paramount added synchronized sound effects and a song by co-star Wallace Beery after the fact to piggyback on the success of the previous year’s “Jazz Singer,” but this silent version of “Beggars” is the only one that remains. Wellman’s son and biographer, William Wellman Jr., will introduce the film and sign copies of his new book, “Wild Bill Wellman: Hollywood Rebel.” At 7:50 p.m., Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, 212-727-8110, filmforum.org. (Eric Grode)‘Haute Couture on Film’ (Tuesdays through May 26) Stealing the spotlight from the likes of Catherine Deneuve, Lauren Bacall and Audrey Hepburn isn’t easy, but Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior and Givenchy — or at least their clothes — pulled it off. French Institute Alliance Française shifts its attention to the great French designers and their best-known creations for the silver screen. Not every one of these films is known for its fashion-forwardness: “The Rules of the Game” (May 5) would be one of the all-time greats if everyone were dressed in gunny sacks instead of Coco Chanel. But the opening offering, “Funny Face,” is a perfect example of how clothes can make even the women who seemed already in good shape. And if the jingoist in you wants to see the United States represented, the series ends with the documentary “Versailles ’73: American Runway Revolution,” in which five American designers did battle against several of those listed above.

Early Japanese Talkies (Wednesday through May 20) When it came to ditching silent film for talkies, the West was an early adopter: Within three years of Al Jolson uttering “You ain’t heard nothin’ yet” in 1927, Western moviegoers were hearing just about nothing but recorded dialogue. Japan, however, didn’t see the majority of its films switch over to sound until 1936, a phenomenon explored in this intriguing retrospective of early efforts. Heavy hitters like Kenji Mizoguchi (“Home Town,” screening Wednesday at 4 p.m.) and Yasujiro Ozu (“The Only Son”) are represented, along with what might be the first North American showing of Mikio Naruse’s “Five Men in the Circus.” Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, 11 West 53rd Street, 212-708-9400, moma.org.

Robert Wise did it by actually giving Ms. Nixon (memorably dubbed “the ghostess with the mostest” by Time magazine) an onscreen role in this much-loved 1965 musical. After watching her as Sister Sophia on screen, you can see Ms. Nixon herself along with the “Sound of Music” historian Tom Santopietro at a pair of screenings of the film, on a new 70mm print courtesy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

"The Films of Robert Redford (Friday through Monday) Way before he became the “Godfather of Indie Film” (a title bestowed last year by Time magazine), Robert Redford was the golden-haired uber-WASP in 1970s studio films like “The Way We Were” and “The Candidate.” Both will be shown in this prelude to Mr. Redford’s being honored at the Film Society of Lincoln Center’s annual Chaplin Award Gala, along with “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” which turned him into a star, and “Ordinary People,” which turned him into an Academy Award-winning director. Among the other highlights are the Hitchcockian “Three Days of the Condor” and “Quiz Show,” in which Mr. Redford detonates the entire golden-boy concept, which he examines through the lens of the 1950s television game show scandal.

(Grode)‘Haute Couture on Film’ (Tuesdays through May 26) Stealing the spotlight from the likes of Catherine Deneuve, Lauren Bacall and Audrey Hepburn isn’t easy, but Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior and Givenchy — or at least their clothes — pulled it off. French Institute Alliance Française shifts its attention to the great French designers and their best-known creations for the silver screen. Not every one of these films is known for its fashion-forwardness: “The Rules of the Game” (May 5) would be one of the all-time greats if everyone were dressed in gunny sacks instead of Coco Chanel. But the opening offering, “Funny Face,” is a perfect example of how clothes can make even the women who seemed already in good shape. And if the jingoist in you wants to see the United States represented, the series ends with the documentary “Versailles ’73: American Runway Revolution,” in which five American designers did battle against several of those listed above. Screenings are at 4 and 7:30 p.m., Florence Gould Hall, French Institute Alliance Française, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, 800-982-2787, fiaf.org. (Grode)Planes, Trains and ... Motorcycles (Friday and Saturday) You can choose your film on the basis of supporting players: Phil Spector and Jack Nicholson vs. Doris Roberts and Jerry Stiller vs. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Ethel Merman. Or you can go by endings and pick a pair of shotgun blasts, a telltale sneeze or a pair of inflatables flying off into the night. Or you can go with all of the above and catch this entire transportation-themed triple bill, which veers from wide-eyed 1960s experimentation (“Easy Rider,” Friday at 8:15 p.m.) to urban-jungle ’70s cynicism (“Taking of Pelham One Two Three,” Saturday at 8 p.m.) to class-clown ’80s japery (“Airplane!,” Saturday at 6 p.m.).

(Grode)‘Required Viewing: Mad Men’s Movie Influences’ (through Sunday) With the head-scratching exception of Jacques Demy’s melancholy “Model Shop,” Don Draper’s moviegoing preferences on “Mad Men” have tended toward the big and brash: “Planet of the Apes,” “Casino Royale.” Matthew Weiner, the creator of Don Draper and everyone else on that show, has more diverse tastes, as shown by the 10 films of his choosing, each of which played a role in molding the “Mad Men” ethos and aesthetic. Surprisingly, only four were released in the 1960s: “The Apartment,” “Les Bonnes Femmes,” “The Americanization of Emily” (Saturday and Sunday) and “Dear Heart.” Among the others is the 1959 working-girl melodrama “The Best of Everything,” which Mr. Weiner has called “part of the group mind-set” for the “Mad Men” pilot.

(Grode)Tsai Ming-liang (through Sunday) This 18-film retrospective, New York’s largest to date of the revered Taiwanese director, offers something close to full immersion in Mr. Tsai’s minutely controlled minimalism. It’s also a great chance to see his on-screen alter ego, Lee Kang-sheng, in a director-actor pairing that rivals Von Sternberg and Dietrich, Kurosawa and Mifune and Scorsese and De Niro. Here Mr. Lee plays everything from an adolescent blackmailer (“Boys”) to a Taipei porn star (the mind-blowing “The Wayward Cloud” ) to a love-struck wristwatch salesman (“What Time Is It There?,” April 24). Through it all, Mr. Tsai takes his time, allowing his constant co-star and everyone around him to squirm at the uncomfortable but dramatically justifiable silences.

(Grode)The Vertigo Effect (through Thursday) Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, though supplanting “Citizen Kane” as the greatest film of all time — as “Vertigo” did in Sight & Sound magazine’s 2012 poll — is pretty flattering, too. Still, plenty of directors have tipped their cap to Alfred Hitchcock’s 1958 classic the traditional way, as this 30-film retrospective shows. There’s “Vertigo” from a feminist perspective (“Variety”), “Vertigo” done for laughs (“High Anxiety,” Wednesday), “Vertigo” as soft-core porn (“Sugar Cookies,” Tuesday) and, in the form of Chris Marker’s unforgettable “Sans Soleil” (Sunday), “Vertigo” as essayistic travelogue. And if you’ve never carved out the time for Douglas Gordon’s self-explanatory art installation “24 Hour Psycho,” Les LeVeque takes Hitchcock in the other direction with “4 Vertigo” (Saturday), which compresses the film into a brain-melting nine minutes.

"Bel Powley‘The Diary of a Teenage Girl’In the 2011 Broadway production of Tom Stoppard’s “Arcadia,” Bel Powley played the brainy young student Thomasina and spoke the play’s first, naughty words: “Septimus, what is carnal embrace?”Ms. Powley’s mastery of Mr. Stoppard’s pyrotechnic language earned her raves from critics, including Ben Brantley of The New York Times, who wrote that she “enchantingly captures the ardor of a brilliant young mind.” Her titillating opening line also foreshadowed her revelatory, daring turn as Minnie Goetz, right, in “The Diary of a Teenage Girl,” the writer-director Marielle Heller’s feature debut (Aug. 7).“Doing that play is what made me think this is what I want to do,” Ms. Powley, now 23, said about her career path. “And Thomasina and Minnie are both interested in sex from a very young age.”Based on Phoebe Gloeckner’s graphic novel of the same name, “The Diary of a Teenage Girl” is set in 1970s San Francisco, where Minnie grows up fast, neglected by her messy bohemian mother (Kristen Wiig) but not by her mother’s early-30s boyfriend (Alexander Skarsgard), with whom she strikes up a complex sexual relationship. Minnie’s story is explicit, sensual, achingly painful and perhaps less apologetic than ever before for a story about a girl grappling with her sexuality.",movies
"Film Series‘Alien’ (Friday and Saturday) Midnight audiences can be a bit unruly, which can be part of the fun, but there are limits. The New York magazine critic Matt Zoller Seitz experienced this a few weeks ago at IFC Center when a particularly rowdy patron disrupted a midnight showing of “Twilight Zone: The Movie” until an usher threw him out — by his wrists. It’s hard to imagine this or any other theater employee begrudging the occasional gasp or yelp at “Alien” (1979), which still holds up as an ironclad shocker. But even if it’s true that in space no one can hear you scream, your voice will be heard from the back of the theater. Be afraid. IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village; 212-924-7771, ifccenter.com. (Eric Grode)Art of the Real (through April 26) This intriguing glimpse at the feistier entries within the category of documentaries, or what Film Society of Lincoln Center somewhat awkwardly calls “documentary as art,” has plenty to recommend it in its second year, including “Will You Dance With Me?,” made of footage that Derek Jarman filmed over one night in 1984 in an East London gay bar. But the sidebar devoted to Agnès Varda alone vaults this series into must-see status. From “Black Panthers,” her blissfully wide-eyed look at a 1968 rally to free Huey P. Newton, to “The Gleaners and I,” a nonpareil meta-commentary on the joys of scavenging (food, dolls, cinema images), the pioneering Ms. Varda _ who will appear at several screenings the weekend of April 17 — has found the art in the real and vice versa for more than 50 years.

Griffith (through April 27) This year is the centennial of Ingrid Bergman, Arthur Miller, Frank Sinatra and, according to a recent New York magazine article, the feature film. This last, factually debatable distinction refers to the 1915 release of the Ku Klux Klan paean “The Birth of a Nation,” which remains as pioneering and as indefensible as ever. It kicked off this nine-week series of Monday screenings dedicated to D.W. Griffith, whose innovations can be seen in virtually every film to follow in his virtuosic wake. The coming weeks will feature Griffith’s “Way Down East” (on Monday), with its white-knuckle chase across real-life ice floes, and concludes with “Isn’t Life Wonderful” on April 27.

Not every one of these films is known for its fashion-forwardness: “The Rules of the Game” (May 5) would be one of the all-time greats if everyone were dressed in gunny sacks instead of Coco Chanel. But the opening offering, “Funny Face,” is a perfect example of how clothes can make even the women who seemed already in good shape. And if the jingoist in you wants to see the United States represented, the series ends with the documentary “Versailles ’73: American Runway Revolution,” in which five American designers did battle against several of those listed above.

(Grode)Mad Men at the Movies (Wednesday and Thursday) The 10-film retrospective curated by the “Mad Men” creator Matthew Weiner at the Museum of the Moving Image apparently didn’t exhaust Mr. Weiner’s list of silver-screen influences. BAMcinématek chimes in with three additional titles, including one _ the 1967 film of “How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying” (Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.) _ with a bit more of the song-and-dance skills that Robert Morse displayed in the recent half-season finale. (Mr. Morse will do a Q. and A. afterward.) There’s also the 1965 noir curiosity “Mirage” (Thursday at 9:45 p.m.), with its suffocating views of midtown Manhattan, and Billy Wilder’s “The Lost Weekend” (Thursday at 7 p.m.), which depicted a New Yorker named Don with a drinking problem back in 1945, when Don Draper was still Dick Whitman. Mr. Weiner will introduce “Mirage” and do a Q. and A. after “Weekend.” BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, 718-636-4100, bam.org.

(Grode)‘Kino!’ (through Thursday) This showcase for contemporary German films, in its second year away from its longtime home at the Museum of Modern Art, returns with 10 full-length films and a collection of shorts. Several of the titles involve criminal ventures ranging from corrupt lobbyists (“The Lies of the Victors”) to compromised cops (“The Kings Surrender”) to cybercriminals (“Who Am I — No System Is Safe”). It’s fitting, then, that the lone documentary, “Beltracchi: The Art of Forgery” (Sunday and Monday), follows the exploits of Wolfgang Beltracchi, who successfully created “lost masterpieces” by the likes of Fernand Léger and Max Ernst for almost four decades. If this all seems too dire, there’s also “The Pasta Detectives” (Saturday and Sunday), adapted from the popular German children’s book. Oh, wait, that one has a serial kidnapper in it.

(Grode)Strictly Sturges (Friday through April 23) Growing up on the road with Isadora Duncan, inventing a kiss-proof lipstick, writing an Academy Award-winning screenplay for $10 (an actual pay raise from the agreed-upon $1) and eloping with C.W. Post’s granddaughter, as Preston Sturges did, could easily lead to an overdeveloped sense of the absurd. Sturges’s towering reputation among Hollywood funnymen rests largely on his incredible winning streak from 1939-43, in which he made seven of the 19 films in this retrospective, including the masterpieces “Sullivan’s Travels” and “The Lady Eve.” One advantage to seeing so much Sturges in such a concentrated dose is watching a repertory company of character actors that may never have been matched in any other director’s work. So if you’d like to call this series Frankly Franklin Pangborn or Totally Torben Meyer, go right ahead.

"The WolfpackOpens June 12It sounds like a Jerzy Kosinski novel. Six brothers and a sister are locked away in a Lower East Side apartment nearly all their young lives because their father (a Peruvian immigrant and Hare Krishna devotee) is afraid New York City would contaminate them. They watch movies constantly and re-enact them with homemade costumes and props. But Crystal Moselle’s film is a documentary — about the Angulo family, nicknamed the Wolfpack, whom she met in 2010. It won the documentary grand jury prize at Sundance.",movies
