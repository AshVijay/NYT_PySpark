      "['In recent years, I’ve caught a rather nasty case of replay anxiety, an increasingly common malady in American sports. The afflicted cannot watch a long touchdown run, a buzzer beater or a no-hitter reach the bottom of the ninth inning without worrying that the unfolding drama will be interrupted by the sight of umpires and referees trotting — always a bit too slowly and dutifully — to the replay monitors to review a call. Sitting on my couch, my eyes darting around the screen, I feel the strain of switching between two parallel realities: what the ref sees and what the machine knows.I feel bad for the refs, who, for the most part, are company men in an industry that desperately wants to replace their jobs with automatons. Management, in this case, seems determined to put the ref’s flaws on full display: Every time the ref makes a mistake — especially one that alters the outcome of a game — it’s played over and over again on the giant glowing Jumbotron that hangs over his head, on the television broadcasts and then again, throughout the night, on “SportsCenter.” By the time he wakes up the next morning, his gaffe will have been thoroughly dissected by the forensic experts of YouTube, who stretch every suspicious five-second clip into a meticulously edited short documentary, complete with a menacing violin soundtrack and enraged, caps-locked captions like: “NOTICE NO FOUL WAS CALLED EVEN THOUGH REFEREE X WAS STANDING TWO FEET AWAY!!!”Even the quants have it out for refs. In 2005, John Ball, a data analyst and rabid Houston Rockets fan, had a fit of referee paranoia. The Rockets had just lost a series to the Dallas Mavericks. Jeff Van Gundy, the Rockets’ coach, had been fined a record $100,000 for insinuating that the Mavericks’ owner, Mark Cuban, had persuaded the referees to call more offensive fouls on the Rockets center Yao Ming. Ball ran a popular Yao fan site at the time, and he later began to compile a database that tracked information on referees’ habits. Along with a small team of fellow analysts, Ball watched hundreds of hours of tape to note all the times when a referee missed a call or ignored a violation. They found that there were roughly 20 to 30 bad calls per game and that each ref has predictable patterns of behavior — some call more charging fouls, others hate to blow the whistle on traveling violations and others give more leniency to superstars. Some N.B.A. teams now use the behavioral patterns Ball tracks to develop game plans around referees. Ball’s data, for example, showed that Derek Fisher, the squat, blockheaded former point guard and recently fired Knicks coach, had an unusual talent for drawing illegal screen calls on his opponents from susceptible referees.', 'sports']\n",
